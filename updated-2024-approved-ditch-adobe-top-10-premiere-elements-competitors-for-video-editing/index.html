<h4 id="1-All-videos-shot-with-GoPro-HD-will-be-in-an-MP4-format-3"><a href="#1-All-videos-shot-with-GoPro-HD-will-be-in-an-MP4-format-3" class="headerlink" title="1. All videos shot with GoPro HD will be in an MP4 format"></a>1. All videos shot with GoPro HD will be in an MP4 format</h4><p>This means you will need to find software that is will be able to import these kinds of files. Make sure you look up the specifications for all of the programs you consider to make sure the one you pick can handle the GoPro format.</p>
<h4 id="2-Consider-what-kind-of-editing-you-are-going-to-do-with-the-file-3"><a href="#2-Consider-what-kind-of-editing-you-are-going-to-do-with-the-file-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Consider what kind of editing you are going to do with the file"></a>2. Consider what kind of editing you are going to do with the file</h4><p>Most free programs make it really easy to do basic editing, but you are going to need to pay for a program if you want to do any heavy duty editing. Make sure you carefully read the features before you download it to make sure you have what you are need to complete your editing. Also, some programs are only free for personal use, so if you need a program for business purposes you are probably going to have to pay a fee.</p>
<h4 id="3-Consider-the-output-formats-3"><a href="#3-Consider-the-output-formats-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Consider the output formats"></a>3. Consider the output formats</h4><p>You will need to check out the different output formats that are available with the free software. If you plan to share the video over social media, make sure that the editing software includes that as an option. If you would like to burn the video to a DVD, make sure that the program is capable of writing to a disc.</p>
<h2 id="Choosing-the-Right-Software-Package-for-Your-GoPro-Project-3"><a href="#Choosing-the-Right-Software-Package-for-Your-GoPro-Project-3" class="headerlink" title="Choosing the Right Software Package for Your GoPro Project"></a>Choosing the Right Software Package for Your GoPro Project</h2><p>Once you are through considering these different points, you can start looking at the different free and easy editing software available. Here are a few suggestions based on how much editing you want to do.</p>
<h4 id="1-Just-the-Basics-3"><a href="#1-Just-the-Basics-3" class="headerlink" title="1 Just the Basics"></a>1 <em>Just the Basics</em></h4><p>There are more options available if you only need to do basic editing, like cutting the length of the video, joining different parts together, or adding music. The following are three of the best programs to handle basic video editing of MP4 files.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows Movie Maker</strong> is a basic Windows program that makes it really easy to manage basic editing, like adding music to one of your favorite videos.</li>
<li><strong>VLC Media Player</strong> is a neat little open-source program that works across different platforms for very basic use.</li>
<li><strong>Animoto</strong> is great for joining together several different videos, although only the Lite account is free and has a number of restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-A-Robust-Program-3"><a href="#2-A-Robust-Program-3" class="headerlink" title="2 A Robust Program"></a>2 <em>A Robust Program</em></h4><p>If you want something robust and effective, the best option is Wondershare Filmora. It lets you do more than just basic editing, allowing you to work with a number of different video formats. Once you download it, you will find that it is very user-friendly from the onset. Best of all, you can share videos from the program, something that the basic editors won’t let you do without paying for that ability.</p>

<p><strong>Magix Movie Edit Pro 2015 Plus</strong> excels in areas of advanced features, formats supported and attractive interface. However, it loses points for slow rendering performance and some complexity in the interface. The low price makes the exchange worth it for many users.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>GoPro HD videos are an incredibly popular format, but it is a bit more of a challenge to find a free editing program that will work with these files. Many free or lite versions of packages let you do very basic editing, but they come with a lot of restrictions and want you to spend money to upgrade it. If you want something that’s easy to use and performs well, Wondershare Filmora is an ideal choice.</p>

<p>In addition, it’s a great idea to play the video in repeat mode when you find a certain piece of a video or an entire clip very intriguing and want to watch it again and again for yourself, your friends, or your intended audience on your social media account.</p>
<p>The loopers come in here because they help make the movie loop several times. In this article, we will share a list of free <strong>Video Looper</strong> online solutions that, according to their regulations, enable you to repeat a piece of video.</p>

If you wish to create a looping video, you’ll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.</p>
<h3 id="1-Window-Media-Player"><a href="#1-Window-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="1. Window Media Player"></a>1. Window Media Player</h3><p>Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company’s de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.</p>
<p>Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in <strong>Now Playing</strong> status to reveal the <em>playback settings</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To continually repeat the movie, click the <strong>Turn Repeat On</strong> button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square <strong>Maximize</strong> symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Until you exit the application or click the <strong>Turn Repeat Off</strong> icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.</p>

                      alt="play video in loop windows media player"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Note:</strong> When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the <strong>Repeat</strong> feature.</p>
<h3 id="2-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#2-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="2. QuickTime Player"></a>2. QuickTime Player</h3><p>QuickTime Player is a basic application that allows you to watch videos and record screencasts on your Mac. You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.</p>
<p>You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.</p>
<p>It can also play your video on loop. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video with QuickTime Player?</strong></p>
<p>If you’re using a Mac and wish to generate a video loop in QuickTime Player, follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the <strong>QuickTime</strong> player to watch any video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: In the taskbar at the top right of the screen, select <strong>View</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the drop-down option, select <strong>Loop</strong>. And that’s it. You have put a video on loop.</p>

                ></p>
<p>These two video programs simplify setting up videos to run on repeat; they don’t allow you to loop individual video parts. To do so, you’ll need more powerful software, such as the well-known VLC Media Player.</p>
<h3 id="3-VLC-Media-Player"><a href="#3-VLC-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="3. VLC Media Player"></a>3. VLC Media Player</h3><p>The VLC media player is a program that allows you to play video and music files on your computer. The VLC player can operate on several operating systems, including Windows 2021, XP, and Mac OS X, because of the device’s powerful CPUs.</p>
<p>This makes the VLC Media Player an excellent alternative for anybody searching for a media player that can simultaneously run many programs. This free video editing program also includes special capabilities that allow it to execute numerous jobs simultaneously, including video editing, data transmission, graphic display, sound editing, and much more.</p>
<p> <strong>How to Loop a part of the Video in VLC Media Player Continuously?</strong></p>
<p>Create a beginning point A and an ending point B, which are in the center of VLC’s timeline. There is a control button for the A to B looping function in the Advanced Controls. The starting and ending positions inside a media file can be specified by bringing up the advanced controls first. Now follow these steps to put a video on loop in the VLC media player:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the video with VLC media player. Go to <strong>View</strong>. Select the <strong>Advanced Controls</strong> option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="vlc media player advanced controls option"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the bottom of the VLC media player, and you will find 4 controls above the play button. Click the third button <strong>Loop from Piont A to Point B continuously</strong> to mark the starting point of the loop; and then click the third button again to mark the end of the loop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="vlc media player loop part of video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the Play button and you will find the video is playing loop. Until you press the Loop from point A to point B option for the third time to discontinue the looped playback, the segment of the clip you’ve put up will keep on playing on loop.</p>
<h3 id="4-iMovie"><a href="#4-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="4. iMovie"></a>4. iMovie</h3><p>iMovie is a fantastic tool for making beautiful short films, music videos, picture slideshows, and other creative projects. You may also loop videos straight in the iMovie software; however, you’ll need to utilize QuickTime to loop movies continually if you want to export them. Here are the quick and easy ways to loop a movie into iMovie.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in iMovie?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open</strong> iMovie and then the video clip you want to loop in.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the <strong>Loop Playback</strong> option from the <strong>View</strong> menu. Once the video begins to play, it will loop indefinitely until you stop it.</p>
<h3 id="5-Windows-Photos-App"><a href="#5-Windows-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="5. Windows Photos App"></a>5. Windows Photos App</h3><p>Microsoft Photos, a free photo viewer and editor bundled with Windows 10, provides capable image editing and photo improvements and capabilities for organizing and editing movies, all in a touch-friendly interface.</p>
<p>You may doodle on photographs, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >apply background music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3D effects to videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and use automated object tagging to make searching easier. Microsoft Photos is a wonderful tool for dealing with digital photographs, and for certain users, it may even replace third-party photo applications.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows 10 Photos app?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 comes with the Photos app preinstalled. It can also assist you in making your movie loop. Here’s how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import your video to the Photos app, and use the trim tool to get the part you want to loop.</p>

<p>Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?</strong></p>

<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square <strong>Maximize</strong> symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Until you exit the application or click the <strong>Turn Repeat Off</strong> icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Loopers-to-Loop-Videos-for-Free-on-Windows-and-Mac-3"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Loopers-to-Loop-Videos-for-Free-on-Windows-and-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac"></a>Part 1: Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac</h2><p>Whatever you are motivated to create a video loop, you should know that it’s a straightforward process. If you wish to create a looping video, you’ll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.</p>
<h3 id="1-Window-Media-Player-3"><a href="#1-Window-Media-Player-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Window Media Player"></a>1. Window Media Player</h3><p>Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company’s de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.</p>
<p>Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in <strong>Now Playing</strong> status to reveal the <em>playback settings</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To continually repeat the movie, click the <strong>Turn Repeat On</strong> button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square <strong>Maximize</strong> symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Until you exit the application or click the <strong>Turn Repeat Off</strong> icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-in-loop-windows-media-player.jpg"
                      alt="play video in loop windows media player"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Note:</strong> When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the <strong>Repeat</strong> feature.</p>
<h3 id="2-QuickTime-Player-3"><a href="#2-QuickTime-Player-3" class="headerlink" title="2. QuickTime Player"></a>2. QuickTime Player</h3><p>QuickTime Player is a basic application that allows you to watch videos and record screencasts on your Mac. You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.</p>
<p>You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.</p>
<p>It can also play your video on loop. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video with QuickTime Player?</strong></p>
<p>If you’re using a Mac and wish to generate a video loop in QuickTime Player, follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the <strong>QuickTime</strong> player to watch any video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: In the taskbar at the top right of the screen, select <strong>View</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the drop-down option, select <strong>Loop</strong>. And that’s it. You have put a video on loop.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="loop video quicktime player"
                ></p>
<p>These two video programs simplify setting up videos to run on repeat; they don’t allow you to loop individual video parts. To do so, you’ll need more powerful software, such as the well-known VLC Media Player.</p>
<h3 id="3-VLC-Media-Player-3"><a href="#3-VLC-Media-Player-3" class="headerlink" title="3. VLC Media Player"></a>3. VLC Media Player</h3><p>The VLC media player is a program that allows you to play video and music files on your computer. The VLC player can operate on several operating systems, including Windows 2021, XP, and Mac OS X, because of the device’s powerful CPUs.</p>
<p>This makes the VLC Media Player an excellent alternative for anybody searching for a media player that can simultaneously run many programs. This free video editing program also includes special capabilities that allow it to execute numerous jobs simultaneously, including video editing, data transmission, graphic display, sound editing, and much more.</p>
<p> <strong>How to Loop a part of the Video in VLC Media Player Continuously?</strong></p>
<p>Create a beginning point A and an ending point B, which are in the center of VLC’s timeline. There is a control button for the A to B looping function in the Advanced Controls. The starting and ending positions inside a media file can be specified by bringing up the advanced controls first. Now follow these steps to put a video on loop in the VLC media player:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the video with VLC media player. Go to <strong>View</strong>. Select the <strong>Advanced Controls</strong> option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-advanced-controls-option.jpg"
                      alt="vlc media player advanced controls option"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the bottom of the VLC media player, and you will find 4 controls above the play button. Click the third button <strong>Loop from Piont A to Point B continuously</strong> to mark the starting point of the loop; and then click the third button again to mark the end of the loop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="vlc media player loop part of video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the Play button and you will find the video is playing loop. Until you press the Loop from point A to point B option for the third time to discontinue the looped playback, the segment of the clip you’ve put up will keep on playing on loop.</p>
<h3 id="4-iMovie-3"><a href="#4-iMovie-3" class="headerlink" title="4. iMovie"></a>4. iMovie</h3><p>iMovie is a fantastic tool for making beautiful short films, music videos, picture slideshows, and other creative projects. You may also loop videos straight in the iMovie software; however, you’ll need to utilize QuickTime to loop movies continually if you want to export them. Here are the quick and easy ways to loop a movie into iMovie.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in iMovie?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open</strong> iMovie and then the video clip you want to loop in.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the <strong>Loop Playback</strong> option from the <strong>View</strong> menu. Once the video begins to play, it will loop indefinitely until you stop it.</p>
<h3 id="5-Windows-Photos-App-3"><a href="#5-Windows-Photos-App-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Windows Photos App"></a>5. Windows Photos App</h3><p>Microsoft Photos, a free photo viewer and editor bundled with Windows 10, provides capable image editing and photo improvements and capabilities for organizing and editing movies, all in a touch-friendly interface.</p>
<p>You may doodle on photographs, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >apply background music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3D effects to videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and use automated object tagging to make searching easier. Microsoft Photos is a wonderful tool for dealing with digital photographs, and for certain users, it may even replace third-party photo applications.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows 10 Photos app?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 comes with the Photos app preinstalled. It can also assist you in making your movie loop. Here’s how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import your video to the Photos app, and use the trim tool to get the part you want to loop.</p>
