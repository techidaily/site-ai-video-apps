The lossy codec formats reduce the size of a video file considerably but they lower the video’s quality, which is why it is better to use lossless codecs if you are recording videos for YouTube and other social media platforms.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-are-the-Most-Common-Video-Compression-and-File-Size-Reduction-Methods-Utilized-by-Video-Compression-Apps"><a href="#Part-3-What-are-the-Most-Common-Video-Compression-and-File-Size-Reduction-Methods-Utilized-by-Video-Compression-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What are the Most Common Video Compression and File Size Reduction Methods Utilized by Video Compression Apps?"></a>Part 3: What are the Most Common Video Compression and File Size Reduction Methods Utilized by Video Compression Apps?</h2><p>After the video recording process is completed there a number of methods you can use to <strong>reduce the size of the file</strong> you created.

It can be used as mentioned to ensure the viewer focuses on what is important, but also to magnify objects on the screen, such as with footage of nature. It has many uses, and one of the best tools available for cropping video is the free program Avidemux. Here we are going to go through the process of getting Avidemux running on your system and cropping some video.</p><hr><p>If Avidemux is too complicate for you, you can consider <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is an easy-to-use video editing tool to crop videos within several click.

Installation"></a>1. Installation</h4><p>You can find <a class="link"   href="http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/" >Avidemux for download here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it is available for a wide range of platforms, just download the version that fits your needs. Once downloaded, install in the standard way for your platform, this is the Wndows version (64bit).</p><p>One point of note during installation is that you can choose which parts of the program you wish to install. It is a very small footprint and for the best performance it is wise to simply install everything.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation2.png"                      alt="Installation2"                ></p><p>Once installed you will be presented with the program as seen here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation3.png"                      alt="Installation3"                ></p><h4 id="2-Importing-Video"><a href="#2-Importing-Video" class="headerlink" title="2. Importing Video"></a>2. Importing Video</h4><p>The next step is importing video. This can be done in two ways, by clicking the file folder icon at the top left you open a standard file browser to navigate to, and select your chosen video file, or alternatively you can simply drag you video into the main panel to import it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video1.png"                      alt="Importing Video1"                ></p><p>Whichever route you take, you will end up with your video file loaded in like this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video2.png"                      alt="Importing Video2"                ></p><p>Now you can edit the video as you need, Avidemux contains a wealth of features to enable the full spectrum of editing tasks to be completed. However, here we are going to look at the cropping tool, so on to the next step.</p><h4 id="3-Editing-Video"><a href="#3-Editing-Video" class="headerlink" title="3. Editing Video"></a>3. Editing Video</h4><p>Avidemux has some idiosyncrasies in terms of operation, one of those is that to be able to edit any video, you have to choose your output format. Don’t worry though, this is easy, just use the dropdown at the side to choose the output format you want as can be seen here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/editing-video.png"                      alt="Editing Video"                ></p><p>Once that is set you are free to start editing your footage.</p><h4 id="4-Cropping"><a href="#4-Cropping" class="headerlink" title="4. Cropping"></a>4. Cropping</h4><p>It is important to understand how the editing process works in Avidemux, everything is accessed via the filters menu Video&gt;Filters and from here you are faced with a new interface that enables you to choose the component you wish to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping.png"                      alt="Cropping1"                ></p><p>Selecting ‘Crop’ from the menu and pressing the green plus symbol at the bottom activated the crop tool and presents you with yet another view that allows you to adjust the crop to your tastes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping2.png"                      alt="Cropping2"                ></p><h4 id="5-Cropping-controls"><a href="#5-Cropping-controls" class="headerlink" title="5. Cropping controls"></a>5. Cropping controls</h4><p>There are two options for cropping, you can use the Auto crop feature, which will detect any black lines and crop the footage between them, or if you are using the crop tool for something else, or just want to do it manually, you can set the crop via the left right top and bottom boxes. Values input here are the number of pixels from that edge the crop extends, as you are setting it, this is displayed with a green block signifying the area of the image that will be removed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls1.png"                      alt="Cropping controls1"                ></p><p>You can adjust this independently for all 4 edges as you wish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls2.png"                      alt="Cropping controls2"                ></p><p>Once you are happy with the crop, you click Ok and it takes you back to the familiar filter menu where you can use other components to perform more editing if you need.</p><h4 id="6-Saving-the-crop"><a href="#6-Saving-the-crop" class="headerlink" title="6. Saving the crop"></a>6. Saving the crop</h4><p>One of the most common points of confusion with Avidemux comes at this point, as your video will look no different to when you started, and many think they have done something wrong, but this is another part of Avidemux workflow. These filters can only be applied when the video is reencoded, and you do that through the file&gt;save menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop1.png"                      alt="Saving the crop1"                ></p><p>Selecting this presents the familiar export dialogue and allows you to choose the name and destination of the file. Once that is done you click OK and you will see Avidemux processing your file and re-rendering it in this dialogue box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop2.png"                      alt="Saving the crop2"                ></p><p>How long it takes will depend on a few factors, how many other effects have been added, how fast a processor your computer has, and how large and what resolution the video is. Format also plays a part in the process too, with some formats taking less time to encode than others. Once it has finished, you can view your video and see the crop in action.</p><p>As we can see, although there are a few aspects of the workflow that are a little unintuitive, cropping video in Avidemux is a straightforward process that anyone can accomplish with a bit of patience.</p><p>One of the key things to remember with Avidemux is that you apply all of your filters before re-encoding, this again is a question of patience and a bit of organization to ensure everything you wish to do is completed in order.</p><p>Avidemux is a great piece of software, it lacks the polish of some of its commercial rivals of course, but behind the sometimes clunky interface there is a very broad range of features that allow you to accomplish more or less any editing task you may want. In terms of free programs this is about as good as it gets, and the output is, without a doubt, great quality. For anyone looking for a free solution to video editing problems, and who do not mind a learning process Avidemux provides a useful tool.</p><h2 id="An-Easier-Way-to-Crop-a-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#An-Easier-Way-to-Crop-a-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="An Easier Way to Crop a Video with Filmora"></a>An Easier Way to Crop a Video with Filmora</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful program that allows you to create stunning video clips in only a few clicks.

You should then create a new project in VSDC, specify the resolution for the entire project and proceed to import all media files you’re going to need during the video editing process, by selecting the Video option from the Add Object menu.</p><p>Place the files on the editor’s timeline so that they are positioned one above the other. The reaction video should occupy the full screen, and you can use the preview window to adjust the size of the reaction video. You should than readjust the on-screen position and the size of the video you’re reacting to, before proceeding to preview the resulting video. In case you like the result you should click on the Export button and choose the output file format and the destination to which the reaction video will be exported.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>No previous video editing experience needed</li><li>Offers a rich selection of transitions and visual effects</li><li>Videos can be exported directly to YouTube from VSDC in resolutions up to 4K</li><li>Offers desktop capturing tools</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Lacks advanced video editing tools</li><li>Outdated interface design</li></ul><h3 id="3-iMovie"><a href="#3-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="3. iMovie"></a>3. iMovie</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, iPhone, iPad</p><p>The process of making a reaction video in iMovie isn’t much different from the process of making any other type of video. Before you start working on your new reaction video, you need to make sure that you have all the media files you want you to use in your project. You can then simply import them into iMovie, and place footage of yourself reacting to a video to the timeline. Afterward, you should place the actual video to which you are reacting above or below the video file that contains the footage of your reaction, depending on which video clip you want to use as a background video.</p><p>However, the overlaid video is not going to be automatically visible in the preview screen, so you should just click on the Video Overlay Settings and pick the Picture in Picture option. As soon as you select this option the overlay video will become visible in the preview window, where you can adjust its size and position. When ready, you should export your reaction video and upload it to your channel.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>The quick and easy video editing process</li><li>Available to all Mac users for free</li><li>Excellent for inexperienced video editors</li><li>A rich selection of visual effects</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>No screen capturing tools</li><li>Audio editing options could be better</li></ul><h3 id="4-OBS"><a href="#4-OBS" class="headerlink" title="4.

Mac and PC users have a broad range of options at their disposal if they want to make still images from their videos. Let’s have a look at some of the best video converters you can use to capture still frames and create JPEG or PNG files.</p><h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Wondershare Filmora"></a>1. Wondershare Filmora</h3><p>Filmora is a video editing software that also offers the option to capture frames of all video clips you use in your projects after you launch the Filmora video editor, import a video file that contains the frames you would like to save as still images.</p><p>To extract still images with the original high quality, you can import and place these videos to Project Media and then double-click it to preview. In the preview window, click the Camera icon located in the lower right corner to take a snapshot. It is worth noting that you can only create PNG files with this video editing software, and you may need to change the photo format if PNG isn’t your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/take-snapchat-9.jpg"                      alt="Extract PNG Image from Filmora9"                ></p><p>Alternatively, you can use the CTRL+ALT+S keyboard shortcut to take a snapshot of the frame in a video clip. The image you created will be added to the Media tab automatically, and you can proceed to right-click on it and select the Reveal in Explorer option to gain access to the original file.</p><p>To extract still image from the video frame by frame, you can add the media asset to the timeline and use the playhead to find the frame you would like to extract from the video. When done, leave the playhead at the location on the timeline where the frame is located, and then click on the Snapshot icon.</p><p> <strong>Below is the video tutorial about how to convert Video to Images Filmora.</strong></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h3 id="2-Adobe-Photoshop"><a href="#2-Adobe-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="2. Adobe Photoshop"></a>2. Adobe Photoshop</h3><p>This is arguably the best photo editing software ever created that grants you access to all the tools you need to manipulate pictures as you see fit. Adobe Photoshop also enables its users to edit videos, although in a limited capacity. In order to turn a video into a series of separate frames, you just have to import a video file into Adobe Photoshop by clicking on the file menu and selecting the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-video-to-image-with-adobe-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="Convert Video to Image in Photoshop"                ></p><p>The video clip is going to be displayed on the timeline that is located at the bottom of the screen and you just have to specify the segment of that file you would like to break down into frames. You can do this by dragging the handles located above the video clip that allows you to set the start and end of the work area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-video-to-images-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="Render Video to convert to Images in PS"                ></p><p>When done, head over to the File menu, and select the Render Video option from the Export submenu. After the Render Video window pops up on the screen, you have to change the Adobe Media Encoder option to Photoshop Image Sequence and then click on the Render button. You should keep in mind that the photo editor is going to create separate image files for all the frames that were within the work area you defined, which is why it is important to reduce the work area to the minimum in order to avoid generating hundreds of JPEG images.</p><h3 id="3-VLC-Media-Player"><a href="#3-VLC-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="3. VLC Media Player"></a>3. VLC Media Player</h3><p>Extracting still frames with VLC media players is a technical process that will require some understanding of the video editing process. Even so, you can still use this open-source software to generate PNG or JPEG files from your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vcl-convert-video-to-image-preference.jpg"                      alt="Convert video to image Preferences  in VCL"                ></p><p>Select the Preferences option from the Tools menu and then click on the Video tab. Make sure that the All option is selected under Show Settings and scroll down until you find the Filters option and expand this menu. Locate the Scene Filter, click on it and then proceed to specify the format in which your images are going to be saved and adjust the Recording Ratio.</p><p>Click on the Save button to confirm the changes, then go back to the Filter submenu, and this time you should click on it rather than expand it. Locate the Scene Video filter, make sure that the checkbox next to it is selected, and click OK to complete the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vcl-video-filter-video-to-image.jpg"                      alt="Convert video to image Preferences  in VCL"                ></p><p>Next time you play a video in VLC the media player will automatically capture still frames at the recording ratio you specified.</p><h3 id="4-Free-Video-to-JPEG-Converter"><a href="#4-Free-Video-to-JPEG-Converter" class="headerlink" title="4. Free Video to JPEG Converter"></a>4. Free Video to JPEG Converter</h3><p>If you are looking for a quick and free way to create still images from videos, this Windows-based tool is one of the least complicated options PC users have at their disposal. After you open Free Video to JPEG Converter you just have to click on the Add Files button and import a video from which you would like to extract still frames.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-video-to-jpeg-converter.jpg"                      alt="Free Video to JPEG Converter"                ></p><p>You can then specify the frequency at which frames are going to be extracted and see the total number of frames that are going to be created from your video. Afterward, you just have to specify the location at which the still frames are going to be saved and click on the Convert button.</p><h3 id="5-Virtual-Dub"><a href="#5-Virtual-Dub" class="headerlink" title="5. Virtual Dub"></a>5. Virtual Dub</h3><p>Before you can start extracting still frames from videos with Virtual Dub, you must first install the FFMpeg plugin pack because this video converter cannot open common video file formats like MP4 or MOV. Installing this plugin can get a little technical, but it is far from being complicated. Afterward, you just have to launch Virtual Dub and import the video you would like to use to create JPEG files by clicking on the File menu and selecting the Open option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-dub-video-to-image-control.jpg"                      alt="Convert Video to Image Virtual Dub"                ></p><p>Select the Frame Rate option from the Video menu and make sure that the checkbox next to the Decimate by setting is selected. Insert the frequency at which still frames are going to be captured into the box next to the Decimate by setting and click on the OK button. Head over to the File menu and select the Image Sequence option from the Export submenu. Before you start extracting still frames from a video you just have to select the file format of the output files, and then wait for Virtual Dub to complete the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Converting-Videos-to-JPEG-or-PNG-Images-Online"><a href="#Part-2-Converting-Videos-to-JPEG-or-PNG-Images-Online" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Converting Videos to JPEG or PNG Images Online"></a>Part 2: Converting Videos to JPEG or PNG Images Online</h2><p>In case you don’t have access to a video or photo editing software and the process of extracting still frames from videos with VLC Media Player or Virtual Dub is too technical for you, there are a number of online solutions you can try. Here are some of the best web-based platforms you can use to convert videos to JPEG or PNG images.</p><h3 id="1-Online-Convert"><a href="#1-Online-Convert" class="headerlink" title="1.

Make the process much easier than you had thought.</p><h2 id="Useful-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-and-Elements-tips"><a href="#Useful-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-and-Elements-tips" class="headerlink" title="Useful Adobe Premiere Pro and Elements tips"></a>Useful Adobe Premiere Pro and Elements tips</h2><h4 id="1-Change-the-default-settings"><a href="#1-Change-the-default-settings" class="headerlink" title="1. Change the default settings"></a>1. Change the default settings</h4><p> You can save some time on video editing by changing two default settings: Scale Media to Project Size and Default Picture Length. You can go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; General to find the two settings. Scale Media to Project Size means any photo or video will be scaled down to the project size. This setting will save you a lot of time especially when you are mixing a lot of SD and HD video and photos. Default Picture Length originally is set at 150 frames or five seconds of footage. You can change it to any set mount so that you don’t need to adjust every photo you import. When you finished the settings changing, hit “OK” to save.</p><h4 id="2-Capture-video-clips-from-your-camcorder-directly"><a href="#2-Capture-video-clips-from-your-camcorder-directly" class="headerlink" title="2.Capture video clips from your camcorder directly"></a>2.Capture video clips from your camcorder directly</h4><p> Remember that you don’t need to transfer your camcorder videos to your hard drive first and then import the video clips to Adobe Premiere. When you have connected your camcorder or other video capture devices to your computer, set the camcorder to playback or set it in VCR mode. Then, in Adobe Premiere, start a new project and go to File &gt; Capture to import your media from your camcorder directly. This will save your some time for Adobe Premiere video editing.</p><h4 id="3-Keep-your-project-more-organized-with-“Bins”"><a href="#3-Keep-your-project-more-organized-with-“Bins”" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep your project more organized with “Bins”"></a>3. Keep your project more organized with “Bins”</h4><p> You can click the “Folder” icon in the “Project” window to create a new folder to store video clips or other things. Store them in many different folders rather than only one so that you can find what you want more quickly. Create bins for storing separate audio, video, photo, etc. This Adobe Premiere tip will definitely makes your project more organized and can save time for editing.</p><h4 id="4-Create-personalized-video-transitions"><a href="#4-Create-personalized-video-transitions" class="headerlink" title="4. Create personalized video transitions"></a>4. Create personalized video transitions</h4><p> When adding transition effects to videos, you can make some adjustments to the transition effects to make them more personalized. You can locate the transition effects in the “Effects” tab. And in the “Effect Controls” tab, you adjust the transitions such as changing the duration time, changing the entrance animation, etc.</p><h4 id="5-Choose-the-most-suitable-output-video-format"><a href="#5-Choose-the-most-suitable-output-video-format" class="headerlink" title="5. Choose the most suitable output video format"></a>5. Choose the most suitable output video format</h4><p> Take the output video quality to consideration when creating a new project in Adobe Premier. For example, if you just want to share the videos on YouTube, then you don’t need to create HD videos because it will take you much more time to upload the videos to Internet if they’re HD videos. Besides, the HD videos also need much more storage space. Get the smaller video size with better compression and easily share your videos on Web.</p><h4 id="6-Quick-render"><a href="#6-Quick-render" class="headerlink" title="6. Quick render"></a>6. Quick render</h4><p> In Adobe Premiere, most effects and videos render in real time.

At the same time, Final Cut Pro X was designed to run on Mac.</p><p>With the recent compatibility of LumaFusion on the M1 MacBook Air, which surfaced in 2020, there have been recent concerns from expert users that very soon, these iOS Pro editing giants may lock horns in no time; if the latter sees more advanced upgrades.</p><p>This article will be giving you a concise yet comprehensive comparison of this editing software, what features to expect, and professional advice to help you choose which one suits your editing needs. Stick with me as I take you on this brief journey into the creative world of LumaFusion and Final Cut Pro X.</p><h2 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-Final-Cut-Pro-X-and-LumaFusion"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-Final-Cut-Pro-X-and-LumaFusion" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of Final Cut Pro X and LumaFusion"></a><strong>Pros and</strong> <strong>Cons</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Final Cut Pro X and</strong> <strong>LumaFusion</strong></h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Pros of LumaFusion</strong></th><th><strong>Pros of Final Cut Pro X</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Portable. You can access all features on the phone</td><td>Allows constant autosave</td></tr><tr><td>Runs on the , which is twice as fast as the .</td><td>Integrates well with studio products</td></tr><tr><td>straightforward interface; easy to navigate</td><td>Professional and rich Interface and layout</td></tr><tr><td>Allows to trim out unused media before export.</td><td>Comes with custom transitions</td></tr><tr><td>Enhance stability and performance</td><td>Sync well with other Apple products</td></tr><tr><td>Quick response while looking for Storyblocks</td><td>Perfect for Hi-tech video manipulation</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cons of LumaFusion</strong></td><td><strong>Cons of Final Cut Pro X</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Difficult with large projects and multi-task</td><td>Relatively expensive</td></tr><tr><td>Advanced features like motion tracking and missing</td><td>Advanced tools are unfriendly for beginners</td></tr><tr><td>Advantages like touch control are limited in Mac</td><td>Exclusively on Mac</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.</p><p>However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.</p><p>But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.</p><h2 id="Price-comparison-between-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion"><a href="#Price-comparison-between-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion" class="headerlink" title="Price comparison between Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Price comparison between Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Final Cut Pro X Price</strong></p><p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a free 90-day trial option on the recent version, and of course, it is only available exclusively on Mac App Store.</p><p>Within the trial period, you would not have access to the 1000+ royalty-free sound effects in the premium version. Still, you can use other unique features for editing, like color correction, adding effects, organizing, editing, and importing and exporting files in different formats.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/FCPX%20price.jpg"                      alt="FCPX price"                ></p><p>During the 90-free trial, you can purchase your Final Cut Pro X, which comes with the Logic Pro built-in for $299, or try the Pro Apps Bundle for Education which has the Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro, Compressor, MainStage, and Motion pre-installed for just $199, which gives you a direct and automatic update on purchase. Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.</p><p><strong>LumaFusion Price</strong></p><p>Compared to other video editing apps in the same category as LumaFision, it has a very flexible pricing system. And since users prefer something with creativity and have a simple interface, it is evident while many new users choose to enjoy the fluid system it portends.</p><p>For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/download%20lumafusion.jpg"                      alt="lumafusion pirce"                ></p><p>Though it comes with no trial policy, recent updates and fixes show that LumaFusion can generally be a dominating app in the editing world.</p><p>Plus, you can always try Filmora for free, it’s popular among beginners and professionals!</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-Interface"><a href="#Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion: Interface"></a><strong>Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion: Interface</strong></h2><p> <strong>Final Cut Pro X</strong></p><p>Many features endeared Final Cut Pro versions to expert users, but more precise advance features like trackless Magnetic Timeline view and great tools for splitting and trimming videos made it more impressive. You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/FCPX%20interface.jpg"                      alt="FCPX interface"                ></p><p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.</p><p>Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.</p><p><strong>LumaFusion</strong></p><p>LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Lumafusion%20interface.jpg"                      alt="Lumafusion interface"                ></p><p>Though many users prefer it to other mobile-based editing apps, others think it is best to introduce it fully on the Mac version because the buttons look a lot more complex for an App. Also, stating that the use of the preview screen is almost irrelevant since it isn’t big due to the mobile display screen.</p><p>However, with a simple drag and drop feature, it is easy to fall in love with this tool, as the interface doesn’t look as complex as some make it seem.</p><h2 id="Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion"><a href="#Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion" class="headerlink" title="Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Is LumaFusion worth it?</strong></p><p>It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.</p><p>Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.</p><p>Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.</p><p>However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.</p><p> <strong>Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?</strong></p><p>High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.</p><p>So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter.

Free Video Cutter"></a>6. Free Video Cutter</h4><p>Freemake video Cutter does exactly what its name suggests, and that is cut video. As well as MP4 it can deal with several other video formats, it uses a nice easy to follow interface and is a nice compact package that does the job well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/free-video-cutter.jpg"                      alt="Free Video Cutter"                ></p><p>One of the easiest to use, a simple interface and good performance.</p><h4 id="7-Freemake-Video-Converter"><a href="#7-Freemake-Video-Converter" class="headerlink" title="7. Freemake Video Converter"></a>7. Freemake Video Converter</h4><p>Whilst, as the name suggests, this package was designed for format conversion, it includes a wealth of other abilities, one of which is video cutting, it can also rejoin and merge clips too. As a video converter, it has the largest range of format compatibility in the list and can even burn your finished videos to DVD or Blu-ray for you. The cutting feature is nicely implemented into a clear interface and should be straightforward for anyone to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/freemake-video-converter.png"                      alt="Freemake Video Converter"                ></p><p>An easy to use interface and a comprehensive feature set far beyond just cutting make this a great general video utility package.</p><h4 id="8-Movica"><a href="#8-Movica" class="headerlink" title="8. Movica"></a>8. Movica</h4><p>This package uses other open source scripting files as the mechanics of doing its job, and is in essence a user interface for those systems. That takes nothing away from it though, the tools it uses are very effective, but in their native form not something most people could take advantage of. In addition to MP4 there are several other video formats available as well as both .wma and .mp3 audio files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/movica1.jpg"                      alt="Movica"                ></p><p>A simple interface and a more technical outlook than many, but it works well.</p><h4 id="9-Virtualdub"><a href="#9-Virtualdub" class="headerlink" title="9. Virtualdub"></a>9. Virtualdub</h4><p>A fairly comprehensive editing package, VirtualDub has a nice selection of cutting tools enabling accurate cuts and edits with ease, covering the MP4 format as well as several others, it is a useful tool for those looking for additional features beyond just cutting. Due to the lengthy feature set the interface is a little cluttered and for those that want nothing but a cutter, is perhaps overkill, however, it does the job very well and for many presents a useful selection of video tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/virtualdub1.png"                      alt="Virtualdub"                ></p><p>With plenty of video tools in addition to cutting, VirtualDub presents an attractive, video toolbox for the enthusiast.</p><h4 id="10-Online-Video-Cutter"><a href="#10-Online-Video-Cutter" class="headerlink" title="10. Online Video Cutter"></a>10. Online Video Cutter</h4><p>Our final offering is a slightly different take on the video cutter. This is an online offering that requires no downloads or installation, you simply go to the website, upload your video or select a video on the web, cut the video and save the output. It is very simple, although there is the obvious issue with larger files of upload and download time, but for many applications is perhaps the ideal solution.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/onlinecutter.png"                      alt="Online Video Cutter"                ></p><p>Without the need to install anything, and with a very simple interface, for smaller files is perhaps the perfect solution.</p><p><a
