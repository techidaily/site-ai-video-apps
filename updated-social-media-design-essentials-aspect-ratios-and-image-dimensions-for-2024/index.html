These days vertical videos are widely used and they also have a market on social media. But before you are creating these videos vertically, you need to be very careful about the things. Here are some tips that can make your vertical videos even better:</p>
<p><strong>Aspect ratios:</strong> The <strong>Aspect ratio for social media</strong>plays a major role in the success of the videos. This is the reason why aspect ratios are must to understand. As far as vertical videos are concerned it can be said that the aspect ratio can be anything just greater than 1:The most recommended aspect ratio for vertical video is 9:16 as it covers the whole screen and also it is more immersive.</p>
<p><strong>Stay closer to the subjects:</strong> When you are shooting your videos in a vertical frame then it can make easier for you to stay closer to your subjects. As people will be scrolling through the application then your video will be at the center. Sometimes, these videos are cut awkwardly. If you shoot the video properly then you can keep yourself away from such issues.</p>
<p><strong>Grab the attention:</strong> users on social media spend no time to switch to another content or other version of the particular content. This is why it becomes so important to catch the attention of your viewers immediately. Try to keep the first couple of moments exceptionally engaging. This will boost the attention of the audience and also make them stay on your video.</p>
<p><strong>Rule of third can benefit you:</strong> If you are wishing to follow this rule then it is important to know the reason behind this rule. This rule means that you should not keep the subject or object directly in front of the frame. This can look ugly and will not suit every time. Instead of this, you can make the use of imaginary vertical and horizontal lines to create better and interesting composition. This will make you frame divided into thirds. Your subject can be placed on these lines or in between the lines where they are meeting. You can get the feature of using the grid as a guide in most of the cameras and phones.</p>
<p><strong>Using the tools:</strong> In order To grab the viewer’s attention it is essential that you are using the right tools.

These days vertical videos are widely used and they also have a market on social media. But before you are creating these videos vertically, you need to be very careful about the things. Here are some tips that can make your vertical videos even better:</p>
<p><strong>Aspect ratios:</strong> The <strong>Aspect ratio for social media</strong>plays a major role in the success of the videos. This is the reason why aspect ratios are must to understand. As far as vertical videos are concerned it can be said that the aspect ratio can be anything just greater than 1:The most recommended aspect ratio for vertical video is 9:16 as it covers the whole screen and also it is more immersive.</p>
<p><strong>Stay closer to the subjects:</strong> When you are shooting your videos in a vertical frame then it can make easier for you to stay closer to your subjects. As people will be scrolling through the application then your video will be at the center. Sometimes, these videos are cut awkwardly. If you shoot the video properly then you can keep yourself away from such issues.</p>
<p><strong>Grab the attention:</strong> users on social media spend no time to switch to another content or other version of the particular content. This is why it becomes so important to catch the attention of your viewers immediately. Try to keep the first couple of moments exceptionally engaging. This will boost the attention of the audience and also make them stay on your video.</p>
<p><strong>Rule of third can benefit you:</strong> If you are wishing to follow this rule then it is important to know the reason behind this rule. This rule means that you should not keep the subject or object directly in front of the frame. This can look ugly and will not suit every time. Instead of this, you can make the use of imaginary vertical and horizontal lines to create better and interesting composition. This will make you frame divided into thirds. Your subject can be placed on these lines or in between the lines where they are meeting. You can get the feature of using the grid as a guide in most of the cameras and phones.</p>

These days vertical videos are widely used and they also have a market on social media. But before you are creating these videos vertically, you need to be very careful about the things. Here are some tips that can make your vertical videos even better:</p>
<p><strong>Aspect ratios:</strong> The <strong>Aspect ratio for social media</strong>plays a major role in the success of the videos. This is the reason why aspect ratios are must to understand. As far as vertical videos are concerned it can be said that the aspect ratio can be anything just greater than 1:The most recommended aspect ratio for vertical video is 9:16 as it covers the whole screen and also it is more immersive.</p>
<p><strong>Stay closer to the subjects:</strong> When you are shooting your videos in a vertical frame then it can make easier for you to stay closer to your subjects. As people will be scrolling through the application then your video will be at the center. Sometimes, these videos are cut awkwardly. If you shoot the video properly then you can keep yourself away from such issues.</p>
<p><strong>Grab the attention:</strong> users on social media spend no time to switch to another content or other version of the particular content. This is why it becomes so important to catch the attention of your viewers immediately. Try to keep the first couple of moments exceptionally engaging. This will boost the attention of the audience and also make them stay on your video.</p>
<p><strong>Rule of third can benefit you:</strong> If you are wishing to follow this rule then it is important to know the reason behind this rule. This rule means that you should not keep the subject or object directly in front of the frame. This can look ugly and will not suit every time. Instead of this, you can make the use of imaginary vertical and horizontal lines to create better and interesting composition. This will make you frame divided into thirds. Your subject can be placed on these lines or in between the lines where they are meeting. You can get the feature of using the grid as a guide in most of the cameras and phones.</p>

These days vertical videos are widely used and they also have a market on social media. But before you are creating these videos vertically, you need to be very careful about the things. Here are some tips that can make your vertical videos even better:</p>
<p><strong>Aspect ratios:</strong> The <strong>Aspect ratio for social media</strong>plays a major role in the success of the videos. This is the reason why aspect ratios are must to understand. As far as vertical videos are concerned it can be said that the aspect ratio can be anything just greater than 1:The most recommended aspect ratio for vertical video is 9:16 as it covers the whole screen and also it is more immersive.</p>
<p><strong>Stay closer to the subjects:</strong> When you are shooting your videos in a vertical frame then it can make easier for you to stay closer to your subjects. As people will be scrolling through the application then your video will be at the center. Sometimes, these videos are cut awkwardly. If you shoot the video properly then you can keep yourself away from such issues.</p>
<p><strong>Grab the attention:</strong> users on social media spend no time to switch to another content or other version of the particular content. This is why it becomes so important to catch the attention of your viewers immediately. Try to keep the first couple of moments exceptionally engaging. This will boost the attention of the audience and also make them stay on your video.</p>
<p><strong>Rule of third can benefit you:</strong> If you are wishing to follow this rule then it is important to know the reason behind this rule. This rule means that you should not keep the subject or object directly in front of the frame. This can look ugly and will not suit every time. Instead of this, you can make the use of imaginary vertical and horizontal lines to create better and interesting composition. This will make you frame divided into thirds. Your subject can be placed on these lines or in between the lines where they are meeting. You can get the feature of using the grid as a guide in most of the cameras and phones.</p>

Where can I download PC games for free?"></a>1. Where can I download PC games for free?</h4><p>There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store &amp; Microsoft stores. You can play &amp; download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com &amp; miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.</p>
<h4 id="2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games"><a href="#2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the safest website to download free games?"></a>2. What is the safest website to download free games?</h4><p>Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android"><a href="#3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="3. Can we download PC games on Android?"></a>3. Can we download PC games on Android?</h4><p>There isn’t a straightforward answer to this question. By ‘download,’ if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia &amp; Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (&amp; in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.</p>

<h3 id="Part-3-FAQs-About-Game-Download-Sites-1"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-About-Game-Download-Sites-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites"></a>Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites</h3><h4 id="1-Where-can-I-download-PC-games-for-free-1"><a href="#1-Where-can-I-download-PC-games-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Where can I download PC games for free?"></a>1. Where can I download PC games for free?</h4><p>There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store &amp; Microsoft stores. You can play &amp; download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com &amp; miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.</p>
<h4 id="2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-1"><a href="#2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-1" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the safest website to download free games?"></a>2. What is the safest website to download free games?</h4><p>Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-1"><a href="#3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Can we download PC games on Android?"></a>3. Can we download PC games on Android?</h4><p>There isn’t a straightforward answer to this question. By ‘download,’ if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia &amp; Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (&amp; in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.</p>

<h3 id="Part-3-FAQs-About-Game-Download-Sites-2"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-About-Game-Download-Sites-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites"></a>Part 3: FAQs About Game Download Sites</h3><h4 id="1-Where-can-I-download-PC-games-for-free-2"><a href="#1-Where-can-I-download-PC-games-for-free-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Where can I download PC games for free?"></a>1. Where can I download PC games for free?</h4><p>There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store &amp; Microsoft stores. You can play &amp; download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com &amp; miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.</p>
<h4 id="2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-2"><a href="#2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-2" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the safest website to download free games?"></a>2. What is the safest website to download free games?</h4><p>Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-2"><a href="#3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Can we download PC games on Android?"></a>3. Can we download PC games on Android?</h4><p>There isn’t a straightforward answer to this question. By ‘download,’ if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia &amp; Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (&amp; in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.</p>

Where can I download PC games for free?"></a>1. Where can I download PC games for free?</h4><p>There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store &amp; Microsoft stores. You can play &amp; download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com &amp; miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.</p>
<h4 id="2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-3"><a href="#2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games-3" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the safest website to download free games?"></a>2. What is the safest website to download free games?</h4><p>Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-3"><a href="#3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Can we download PC games on Android?"></a>3. Can we download PC games on Android?</h4><p>There isn’t a straightforward answer to this question. By ‘download,’ if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia &amp; Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (&amp; in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.</p>

<p>It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learning a new language.</p>
<p>This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024</p>
<h2 id="The-Best-App-of-2024-Selected-by-Google-Play-Ablo"><a href="#The-Best-App-of-2024-Selected-by-Google-Play-Ablo" class="headerlink" title="The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: Ablo"></a>The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en" >Ablo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.</p>

<p>It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learning a new language.</p>
<p>This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024</p>
<h2 id="The-Best-App-of-2024-Selected-by-Google-Play-Ablo-2"><a href="#The-Best-App-of-2024-Selected-by-Google-Play-Ablo-2" class="headerlink" title="The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: Ablo"></a>The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en" >Ablo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.</p>

                      alt=" 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world "
                ></p>
<p>Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.</p>
<p>The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.</p>

Over the course of 2024 apps from a broad range of categories have sparked the interest of thousands of Android users. Here are some of the most popular apps of 2024 that can help you improve your productivity or make better fashion choices.</p>
<h3 id="1-Peloton-2"><a href="#1-Peloton-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

                      alt="InShot Video Editor - Glitch Video Effects "
                ></p>
<p>Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors. If you already own a Peloton bike or tread, then you can enjoy all the benefits of the Peloton app for free. Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.</p>

<p>If you would like to keep track of the latest fashion trends and discover places where you can buy clothes and accessories worn by your favorite influencers, then you should install the 21 Buttons app on your phone. This social network for fashion enthusiasts can help you choose new outfits and save them in your public or private closets. What’s more, you can share the fashion choices with your followers and link to the stores where particular items can be purchased. This app also enables you to search for up and coming brands, since it is hard to find a fashion brand that isn’t featured on 21 Buttons.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Managing and organizing vast amounts of handwritten notes is a futile effort as sorting out hundreds of tiny pieces of paper is often impossible. Installing the Post-it app that captures handwritten notes and allows you to organize them in any way you want can help you perform your daily tasks more efficiently. Once you’ve created and organized your board you can share it with your colleagues or export it to Excel, PowerPoint or Trello. Post-it can capture more than 200 notes at the same time using your phone’s camera and use the Handwriting Recognition AI to transcribe them. Each not you create with this app can be easily edited or deleted.</p>

<h5 id="Richard-Bennett-3"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-3" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learning a new language.</p>
<p>This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024</p>
<h2 id="The-Best-App-of-2024-Selected-by-Google-Play-Ablo-3"><a href="#The-Best-App-of-2024-Selected-by-Google-Play-Ablo-3" class="headerlink" title="The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: Ablo"></a>The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en" >Ablo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.</p>
<p><img

                      alt=" 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world "
                ></p>
<p>Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.</p>
<p>The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.</p>
<h2 id="The-Most-Popular-Apps-of-2024-on-Google-Play-3"><a href="#The-Most-Popular-Apps-of-2024-on-Google-Play-3" class="headerlink" title="The Most Popular Apps of 2024 on Google Play"></a>The Most Popular Apps of 2024 on Google Play</h2><p>Smartphones bring entertainment to the palms of our hands and grant us instant access to information that makes our lives easier. Over the course of 2024 apps from a broad range of categories have sparked the interest of thousands of Android users. Here are some of the most popular apps of 2024 that can help you improve your productivity or make better fashion choices.</p>
<h3 id="1-Peloton-3"><a href="#1-Peloton-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Peloton"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepeloton.callisto&hl=en" >Peloton <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>**Price:**Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>

                      alt="InShot Video Editor - Glitch Video Effects "
                ></p>
<p>Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors. If you already own a Peloton bike or tread, then you can enjoy all the benefits of the Peloton app for free. Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you would like to keep track of the latest fashion trends and discover places where you can buy clothes and accessories worn by your favorite influencers, then you should install the 21 Buttons app on your phone. This social network for fashion enthusiasts can help you choose new outfits and save them in your public or private closets. What’s more, you can share the fashion choices with your followers and link to the stores where particular items can be purchased. This app also enables you to search for up and coming brands, since it is hard to find a fashion brand that isn’t featured on 21 Buttons.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Managing and organizing vast amounts of handwritten notes is a futile effort as sorting out hundreds of tiny pieces of paper is often impossible. Installing the Post-it app that captures handwritten notes and allows you to organize them in any way you want can help you perform your daily tasks more efficiently. Once you’ve created and organized your board you can share it with your colleagues or export it to Excel, PowerPoint or Trello. Post-it can capture more than 200 notes at the same time using your phone’s camera and use the Handwriting Recognition AI to transcribe them. Each not you create with this app can be easily edited or deleted.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Learning a new language should be a fun process that is not going to take too much of your time. Scripts by Drops limits the total amount of time you can spend practicing a new language to just five minutes a day. Even though this may seem far from enough to master Chinese Hanzi or to learn Russian Cyrillic, this app will deliver the results you’re looking for as long as you keep using it every single day. Scripts by Drops employs visual learning techniques that help the app’s users connect letters and characters to their pronunciations. If you opt for one of the available subscription models you will have an unlimited amount of learning time at your disposal.</p>
