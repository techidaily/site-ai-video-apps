Windows 10 Photos App"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" >Windows 10 Photos App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The Photos app is the only built-in app on Windows 10 that offers video editing features. Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.</p>
<p>You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.</p>
<p>Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.</p>

You can export all your projects to your accounts on Vimeo or YouTube directly from Filmora, but you should keep in mind that all videos created with the free version of this video editor are going to be watermarked.</p>

<p>That is why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best iMovie replacements for Windows 10 you can use to create stunning videos that are going to attract the attention of your online audience.</p>

Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.</p>
<p>You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.</p>
<p>Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.</p>

<p>Brightening an iPhone video can help you see the activity on-screen and make it more appealing if you share it on social media or post it to a website.</p>
<p>Because the iPhone’s built-in camera app does not enable you to brighten films after they have been recorded, you should always try to light a video before you begin recording.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Switch to video mode by opening the camera app and swiping left. Touch the screen to bring up a box with a sun-shaped symbol.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Move your fingers upward on the iPhone screen to brighten the scene when you begin filming. This may be done at any moment while the video is being recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>There are a ton of <strong>Video Brightening Editor Apps</strong> that will make brightening the videos after filming quite easy for you. Long gone are the days when you had to re-film now and again until you would get that one final shot that has every color adjustment aspect fit to perfection. With the advent of amazing software such as those covered in this article, brightening a dark video has never been easier!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="16:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone3.jpg"
                      alt="letterbox image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg"
                      alt="18:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>

<p>1 – High production quality is not essential</p>
<p>Yes, the content is the king, and people or the end customers may not notice your video quality than the content. So, don’t be afraid when you start and move ahead with your DIY budget.</p>
<p>2 – Use the Ideal Dimensions</p>
<p>Whether it’s <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong> or other Android and Windows devices, you need to use the ideal dimensions already discussed above.</p>
<p>3 – Engage your audience better</p>
<p>You can incorporate little details within the video and engage your audience better. You can also add captions and burn them within the video.</p>
<p>4 – Optimize vertical videos</p>
<p>You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won’t achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don’t.</p>
<p>5 – Capture Attention</p>
<p>Yes, you need to attract the audience and capture their attention within seconds. And, it’s the only or one of the best tricks t get your audience hooked for the long term. Don’t underestimate the significance of storytelling, and you can thus add them for creative looks.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone"><a href="#Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone"></a>Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone</h2><p>Are you looking to capture the video in the correct <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>? In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone7.jpg"
                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone8.jpg"
                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone9.jpg"
                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-1"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-1"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>

                      alt="16:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="letterbox image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="18:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>

<p>1 – High production quality is not essential</p>
<p>Yes, the content is the king, and people or the end customers may not notice your video quality than the content. So, don’t be afraid when you start and move ahead with your DIY budget.</p>
<p>2 – Use the Ideal Dimensions</p>
<p>Whether it’s <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong> or other Android and Windows devices, you need to use the ideal dimensions already discussed above.</p>
<p>3 – Engage your audience better</p>
<p>You can incorporate little details within the video and engage your audience better. You can also add captions and burn them within the video.</p>
<p>4 – Optimize vertical videos</p>
<p>You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won’t achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don’t.</p>
<p>5 – Capture Attention</p>
<p>Yes, you need to attract the audience and capture their attention within seconds. And, it’s the only or one of the best tricks t get your audience hooked for the long term. Don’t underestimate the significance of storytelling, and you can thus add them for creative looks.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-1"><a href="#Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone"></a>Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone</h2><p>Are you looking to capture the video in the correct <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>? In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone7.jpg"
                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>

<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>

<p>4 – Optimize vertical videos</p>
<p>You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won’t achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don’t.</p>

In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone7.jpg"
                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>

                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>

Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>

<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>

In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>

                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>

                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>

                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.</p>
<p>Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in <strong>Now Playing</strong> status to reveal the <em>playback settings</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To continually repeat the movie, click the <strong>Turn Repeat On</strong> button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square <strong>Maximize</strong> symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Until you exit the application or click the <strong>Turn Repeat Off</strong> icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.</p>

If you wish to create a looping video, you’ll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.</p>
<h3 id="1-Window-Media-Player-3"><a href="#1-Window-Media-Player-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.</p>
<p>Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in <strong>Now Playing</strong> status to reveal the <em>playback settings</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To continually repeat the movie, click the <strong>Turn Repeat On</strong> button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square <strong>Maximize</strong> symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Until you exit the application or click the <strong>Turn Repeat Off</strong> icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.</p>

<p> <strong>Note:</strong> When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the <strong>Repeat</strong> feature.</p>

You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.</p>
<p>You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.</p>
<p>It can also play your video on loop. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video with QuickTime Player?</strong></p>
<p>If you’re using a Mac and wish to generate a video loop in QuickTime Player, follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the <strong>QuickTime</strong> player to watch any video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: In the taskbar at the top right of the screen, select <strong>View</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the drop-down option, select <strong>Loop</strong>. And that’s it. You have put a video on loop.</p>

<p>These two video programs simplify setting up videos to run on repeat; they don’t allow you to loop individual video parts. To do so, you’ll need more powerful software, such as the well-known VLC Media Player.</p>
<h3 id="3-VLC-Media-Player-3"><a href="#3-VLC-Media-Player-3" class="headerlink" title="3. VLC Media Player"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/" >VLC Media Player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The VLC media player is a program that allows you to play video and music files on your computer. The VLC player can operate on several operating systems, including Windows 2021, XP, and Mac OS X, because of the device’s powerful CPUs.</p>
<p>This makes the VLC Media Player an excellent alternative for anybody searching for a media player that can simultaneously run many programs. This free video editing program also includes special capabilities that allow it to execute numerous jobs simultaneously, including video editing, data transmission, graphic display, sound editing, and much more.</p>
<p> <strong>How to Loop a part of the Video in VLC Media Player Continuously?</strong></p>
<p>Create a beginning point A and an ending point B, which are in the center of VLC’s timeline. There is a control button for the A to B looping function in the Advanced Controls. The starting and ending positions inside a media file can be specified by bringing up the advanced controls first. Now follow these steps to put a video on loop in the VLC media player:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the video with VLC media player. Go to <strong>View</strong>. Select the <strong>Advanced Controls</strong> option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="vlc media player advanced controls option"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the bottom of the VLC media player, and you will find 4 controls above the play button. Click the third button <strong>Loop from Piont A to Point B continuously</strong> to mark the starting point of the loop; and then click the third button again to mark the end of the loop.</p>

                      alt="vlc media player loop part of video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the Play button and you will find the video is playing loop. Until you press the Loop from point A to point B option for the third time to discontinue the looped playback, the segment of the clip you’ve put up will keep on playing on loop.</p>

You may also loop videos straight in the iMovie software; however, you’ll need to utilize QuickTime to loop movies continually if you want to export them. Here are the quick and easy ways to loop a movie into iMovie.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Open</strong> iMovie and then the video clip you want to loop in.</p>
