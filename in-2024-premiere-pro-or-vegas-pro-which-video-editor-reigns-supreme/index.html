<p>It’s an age-old battle, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/" >Vegas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Premiere <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a comparison that many have made over the last few years in the market, as always when making a comparison, things are always skewed by the writer’s own views, so it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions. Here we aim to lay out the specifications of each product and discuss their effects on workflow, output, and usability to form an opinion beyond the ‘this is the one I like’ argument. However, we are aware of making a completely fair comparison is impossible. We will try our best. Hope you will enjoy it!</p>

<p>Again the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html" >Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of ‘things’, so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere’s more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.</p>
<p>Underneath the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/" >Vegas specifications <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.</p>
<p>I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.udemy.com/" >the major difference for new users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe’s own online video education for the software.</p>
<h4 id="2-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Specification-Comparison"><a href="#2-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Specification-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison"></a>2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison</h4><p>As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases" >Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn’t even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.</p>
<p>It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn’t tell the whole story, with the audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html" >effect modules more advanced in Premiere <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Workflow-comparison"><a href="#3-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Workflow-comparison" class="headerlink" title="3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison"></a>3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison</h4><p>Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html" >media formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - of Adobe’s product makes it a superior product for long-term use.</p>
<p>The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.</p>
<h4 id="4-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Compatibility-Comparison"><a href="#4-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Compatibility-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison"></a>4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison</h4><p>There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe’s strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >in the case of video effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-FAQ-about-Vegas"><a href="#Part-2-FAQ-about-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: FAQ about Vegas"></a>Part 2: FAQ about Vegas</h2><h3 id="1-Can-Sony-Vegas-be-used-on-a-Mac"><a href="#1-Can-Sony-Vegas-be-used-on-a-Mac" class="headerlink" title="1. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?"></a>1. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?</h3><p>Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.</p>
<p>It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Digital Audio Workstation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.</p>
<p>I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.</p>
<p>Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.</p>
<h3 id="2-Is-there-a-Sony-Vegas-for-free"><a href="#2-Is-there-a-Sony-Vegas-for-free" class="headerlink" title="2. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?"></a>2. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?</h3><p>No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.</p>
<p>Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas ‘Pro’ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.</p>
<p>Both come at a premium cost anyway.</p>
<h3 id="3-How-much-does-Sony-Vegas-cost"><a href="#3-How-much-does-Sony-Vegas-cost" class="headerlink" title="3. How much does Sony Vegas cost?"></a>3. How much does Sony Vegas cost?</h3><p>There are <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >different plans of the Sony Vegas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> such as Vegas Pro Edit, Vegas Pro, Vegas Pro 365, Vegas Pro Suite. The Vegas Pro Edit generally costs around $698. Next, The Vegas Pro comes at the cost of $898. The popular Vegas Pro 365 is priced at $16.67 for every 3 months.</p>
<p>So, you need to pay a total of $66.68 annually. Lastly, the Sony Vegas Pro Suite comes at $1098 and is the costliest of all the versions.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, Premiere is the more capable program, both in terms of workflow, output, and its ability to integrate with other applications to produce much more advanced output. For anyone looking for more than just an editor, it is the choice to make. Find some instructional material, dive in, and have fun.</p>
<p>This is a basic comparison between Adobe Premiere and Sony Vegas, which both are professional video editing software.

<p>It’s an age-old battle, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/" >Vegas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Premiere <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a comparison that many have made over the last few years in the market, as always when making a comparison, things are always skewed by the writer’s own views, so it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions. Here we aim to lay out the specifications of each product and discuss their effects on workflow, output, and usability to form an opinion beyond the ‘this is the one I like’ argument. However, we are aware of making a completely fair comparison is impossible. We will try our best. Hope you will enjoy it!</p>

<p>Again the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html" >Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of ‘things’, so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere’s more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.</p>
<p>Underneath the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/" >Vegas specifications <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.</p>
<p>I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.udemy.com/" >the major difference for new users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe’s own online video education for the software.</p>
<h4 id="2-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Specification-Comparison-1"><a href="#2-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Specification-Comparison-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison"></a>2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison</h4><p>As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases" >Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn’t even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.</p>
<p>It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn’t tell the whole story, with the audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html" >effect modules more advanced in Premiere <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Workflow-comparison-1"><a href="#3-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Workflow-comparison-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison"></a>3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison</h4><p>Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html" >media formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - of Adobe’s product makes it a superior product for long-term use.</p>
<p>The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.</p>
<h4 id="4-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Compatibility-Comparison-1"><a href="#4-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Compatibility-Comparison-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison"></a>4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison</h4><p>There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe’s strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >in the case of video effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.</p>

Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?"></a>1. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?</h3><p>Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.</p>
<p>It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Digital Audio Workstation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.</p>
<p>I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.</p>
<p>Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.</p>
<h3 id="2-Is-there-a-Sony-Vegas-for-free-1"><a href="#2-Is-there-a-Sony-Vegas-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?"></a>2. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?</h3><p>No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.</p>
<p>Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas ‘Pro’ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.</p>
<p>Both come at a premium cost anyway.</p>
<h3 id="3-How-much-does-Sony-Vegas-cost-1"><a href="#3-How-much-does-Sony-Vegas-cost-1" class="headerlink" title="3. How much does Sony Vegas cost?"></a>3. How much does Sony Vegas cost?</h3><p>There are <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >different plans of the Sony Vegas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> such as Vegas Pro Edit, Vegas Pro, Vegas Pro 365, Vegas Pro Suite. The Vegas Pro Edit generally costs around $698. Next, The Vegas Pro comes at the cost of $898. The popular Vegas Pro 365 is priced at $16.67 for every 3 months.</p>
<p>So, you need to pay a total of $66.68 annually. Lastly, the Sony Vegas Pro Suite comes at $1098 and is the costliest of all the versions.</p>

<p>It’s an age-old battle, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/" >Vegas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Premiere <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a comparison that many have made over the last few years in the market, as always when making a comparison, things are always skewed by the writer’s own views, so it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions. Here we aim to lay out the specifications of each product and discuss their effects on workflow, output, and usability to form an opinion beyond the ‘this is the one I like’ argument. However, we are aware of making a completely fair comparison is impossible. We will try our best. Hope you will enjoy it!</p>

<p>Again the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html" >Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of ‘things’, so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere’s more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.</p>
<p>Underneath the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/" >Vegas specifications <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.</p>
<p>I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.udemy.com/" >the major difference for new users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe’s own online video education for the software.</p>
<h4 id="2-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Specification-Comparison-2"><a href="#2-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Specification-Comparison-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison"></a>2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison</h4><p>As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases" >Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn’t even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.</p>
<p>It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn’t tell the whole story, with the audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html" >effect modules more advanced in Premiere <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Workflow-comparison-2"><a href="#3-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Workflow-comparison-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison"></a>3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison</h4><p>Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html" >media formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - of Adobe’s product makes it a superior product for long-term use.</p>
<p>The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.</p>
<h4 id="4-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Compatibility-Comparison-2"><a href="#4-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Compatibility-Comparison-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison"></a>4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison</h4><p>There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe’s strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >in the case of video effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-FAQ-about-Vegas-2"><a href="#Part-2-FAQ-about-Vegas-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: FAQ about Vegas"></a>Part 2: FAQ about Vegas</h2><h3 id="1-Can-Sony-Vegas-be-used-on-a-Mac-2"><a href="#1-Can-Sony-Vegas-be-used-on-a-Mac-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?"></a>1. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?</h3><p>Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.</p>
<p>It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Digital Audio Workstation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.</p>
<p>I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.</p>
<p>Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.</p>
<h3 id="2-Is-there-a-Sony-Vegas-for-free-2"><a href="#2-Is-there-a-Sony-Vegas-for-free-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?"></a>2. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?</h3><p>No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.</p>
<p>Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas ‘Pro’ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.</p>
<p>Both come at a premium cost anyway.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, Premiere is the more capable program, both in terms of workflow, output, and its ability to integrate with other applications to produce much more advanced output.

<p>It’s an age-old battle, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/" >Vegas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Premiere <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a comparison that many have made over the last few years in the market, as always when making a comparison, things are always skewed by the writer’s own views, so it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions. Here we aim to lay out the specifications of each product and discuss their effects on workflow, output, and usability to form an opinion beyond the ‘this is the one I like’ argument. However, we are aware of making a completely fair comparison is impossible. We will try our best. Hope you will enjoy it!</p>

<p>Again the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html" >Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of ‘things’, so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere’s more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.</p>
<p>Underneath the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/" >Vegas specifications <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.</p>
<p>I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.udemy.com/" >the major difference for new users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe’s own online video education for the software.</p>
<h4 id="2-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Specification-Comparison-3"><a href="#2-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Specification-Comparison-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison"></a>2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison</h4><p>As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases" >Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn’t even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.</p>
<p>It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn’t tell the whole story, with the audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html" >effect modules more advanced in Premiere <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.</p>
<h4 id="3-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Workflow-comparison-3"><a href="#3-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Workflow-comparison-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison"></a>3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison</h4><p>Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html" >media formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - of Adobe’s product makes it a superior product for long-term use.</p>
<p>The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.</p>
<h4 id="4-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Compatibility-Comparison-3"><a href="#4-Sony-Vegas-VS-Adobe-Premiere-Compatibility-Comparison-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison"></a>4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison</h4><p>There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe’s strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >in the case of video effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.</p>

Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?"></a>1. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?</h3><p>Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.</p>
<p>It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Digital Audio Workstation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.</p>
<p>I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.</p>
<p>Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.</p>

Is there a Sony Vegas for free?</h3><p>No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.</p>
<p>Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas ‘Pro’ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.</p>
<p>Both come at a premium cost anyway.</p>

How much does Sony Vegas cost?</h3><p>There are <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >different plans of the Sony Vegas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> such as Vegas Pro Edit, Vegas Pro, Vegas Pro 365, Vegas Pro Suite. The Vegas Pro Edit generally costs around $698. Next, The Vegas Pro comes at the cost of $898. The popular Vegas Pro 365 is priced at $16.67 for every 3 months.</p>
<p>So, you need to pay a total of $66.68 annually. Lastly, the Sony Vegas Pro Suite comes at $1098 and is the costliest of all the versions.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, Premiere is the more capable program, both in terms of workflow, output, and its ability to integrate with other applications to produce much more advanced output. For anyone looking for more than just an editor, it is the choice to make. Find some instructional material, dive in, and have fun.</p>

<p>First, let’s talk about what Ken Burns is and why he has an effect named after him in Final Cut programs!</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-Ken-Burns-Effect"><a href="#What-is-the-Ken-Burns-Effect" class="headerlink" title="What is the Ken Burns Effect"></a>What is the Ken Burns Effect</h3><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken%5FBurns%5Feffect" >Ken Burns <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a world-famous American documentary filmmaker. He is well known for producing documentaries that take a candid if somewhat old-world-feeling look into different worlds. He has covered Baseball, the Civil War, and other fascinating times and places. Arguably, he is best known for using archival footage as film footage. How does he do this? By using the Ken Burns Effect, of course.</p>
<p>The Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X allows the editor to zoom in and out, slow pan, and scroll across archive photography and still film. This will enable you to substitute whole parts of the program you are making with photographs if you haven’t taken enough footage. It is commonly used in editing, particularly when making things like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >wedding videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which often feature lots of photos of the happy couple.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s look at how you implement the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-Making-the-Ken-Burns-Effect-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Steps-to-Making-the-Ken-Burns-Effect-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Making the Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to Making the Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro</h3><p>Now that we know what is Ken Burns Effect. Let’s go over the steps to making the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Import your video. From your timeline workspace, select the clip, or highlight the section of the clip, that you want to apply the Ken Burns Effect to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/import-media-final-cut-pro.JPG"
                      alt="import media"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Enter into the viewer mode to do this. From here, select the pop-up menu from the list of options at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Hold down both the shift key and the letter C. This is the fast way to cut out what you need. You can always stick to the right-click to cut a clip if you are more comfortable with this.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – scroll down until you find the Ken Burns Effect option in the control panel. The effect should now appear on your page, in the area you selected.</p>
<h3 id="Ken-Burns-Customization"><a href="#Ken-Burns-Customization" class="headerlink" title="Ken Burns Customization"></a>Ken Burns Customization</h3><p>You can also customize the ken burns effects in Final Cut.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – To transform from the Ken Burns Effect into customization mode, drag the green box in the viewer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Adjust the green box’s size, shape, and height until you are happy with where it is placed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="customize ken burns effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Checking what you have already put in place using the preview option is a good idea at this stage. You can edit mistakes out later, but when you are trying to edit for speed, it is best to get it right the first time around!</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – Adjust the viewer to accommodate any changes you need to make – don’t click the done button until you are sure. That being said, you can always back-step should you mis-click. You can also just start over with the effect customization if you messed up.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Zoom-in-Final-Cut-Pro-Using-Keyframing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Zoom-in-Final-Cut-Pro-Using-Keyframing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing"></a>Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing</h2><p>Now that we know how to open and apply the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro. Let’s examine how we zoom in Final Cut Pro using keyframing. Keyframing, of course, involves <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >basic animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allows movement to be added to a still frame. So how do you use the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X in conjunction with keyframing? Let’s talk you through it.</p>
<p>You can use keyframing to zoom and pan. We will talk you through how you use it to zoom in, and you should be able to work out the rest from there.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Set the playhead at the start of the chosen clip. This is where you want the zoom effect to start from.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Click to select the effects menu. It should be at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Seek out the scale and position tools. You can use these to size your animation, decide how much of a zoom you like, and how fast it will go.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/scale-and-position-final-cut.jpg"
                      alt="scale and position"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – Follow keyframe &gt; size &gt; position and ensure your clip is covered as you need it. You can always come back to this step a few times if you don’t get it immediately right.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> – Set the playhead where you want the clip and animation to end. Remember – if you zoom or pan too fast, you might glitch in your footage. Do it on time for the best results.</p>
<p><strong>As a Pro Tip</strong>: you will be baled to view all keyframes on your clip if you select show video animation from your timeline.</p>
<h2 id="The-Ken-Burns-Conclusion"><a href="#The-Ken-Burns-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="The Ken Burns Conclusion"></a>The Ken Burns Conclusion</h2><p>The Ken Burns Effect is famous for a reason. It allows you to fill up space if you don’t have footage for certain things. It can be used to depict ancient battles without the use of CGI.</p>
<p>The Ken Burns Effect, Final Cut Pro (X) technique lets filmmakers go to places that they wouldn’t otherwise get to. It is excellent for both glimpsing into the past, and for flashing forward into imagined futures. Best of all, it lets you go there when you aren’t a big-budget Hollywood film producer. We love anything that saves a buck or two while we edit.</p>

<p>First, let’s talk about what Ken Burns is and why he has an effect named after him in Final Cut programs!</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-Ken-Burns-Effect-2"><a href="#What-is-the-Ken-Burns-Effect-2" class="headerlink" title="What is the Ken Burns Effect"></a>What is the Ken Burns Effect</h3><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken%5FBurns%5Feffect" >Ken Burns <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a world-famous American documentary filmmaker. He is well known for producing documentaries that take a candid if somewhat old-world-feeling look into different worlds. He has covered Baseball, the Civil War, and other fascinating times and places. Arguably, he is best known for using archival footage as film footage. How does he do this? By using the Ken Burns Effect, of course.</p>
<p>The Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X allows the editor to zoom in and out, slow pan, and scroll across archive photography and still film. This will enable you to substitute whole parts of the program you are making with photographs if you haven’t taken enough footage. It is commonly used in editing, particularly when making things like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >wedding videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which often feature lots of photos of the happy couple.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s look at how you implement the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-Making-the-Ken-Burns-Effect-Final-Cut-Pro-2"><a href="#Steps-to-Making-the-Ken-Burns-Effect-Final-Cut-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Making the Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to Making the Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro</h3><p>Now that we know what is Ken Burns Effect. Let’s go over the steps to making the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Import your video. From your timeline workspace, select the clip, or highlight the section of the clip, that you want to apply the Ken Burns Effect to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/import-media-final-cut-pro.JPG"
                      alt="import media"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Enter into the viewer mode to do this. From here, select the pop-up menu from the list of options at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Hold down both the shift key and the letter C. This is the fast way to cut out what you need. You can always stick to the right-click to cut a clip if you are more comfortable with this.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – scroll down until you find the Ken Burns Effect option in the control panel. The effect should now appear on your page, in the area you selected.</p>
<h3 id="Ken-Burns-Customization-2"><a href="#Ken-Burns-Customization-2" class="headerlink" title="Ken Burns Customization"></a>Ken Burns Customization</h3><p>You can also customize the ken burns effects in Final Cut.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – To transform from the Ken Burns Effect into customization mode, drag the green box in the viewer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Adjust the green box’s size, shape, and height until you are happy with where it is placed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="customize ken burns effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Checking what you have already put in place using the preview option is a good idea at this stage. You can edit mistakes out later, but when you are trying to edit for speed, it is best to get it right the first time around!</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – Adjust the viewer to accommodate any changes you need to make – don’t click the done button until you are sure. That being said, you can always back-step should you mis-click. You can also just start over with the effect customization if you messed up.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Zoom-in-Final-Cut-Pro-Using-Keyframing-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Zoom-in-Final-Cut-Pro-Using-Keyframing-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing"></a>Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing</h2><p>Now that we know how to open and apply the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro. Let’s examine how we zoom in Final Cut Pro using keyframing. Keyframing, of course, involves <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >basic animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allows movement to be added to a still frame. So how do you use the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X in conjunction with keyframing? Let’s talk you through it.</p>
<p>You can use keyframing to zoom and pan. We will talk you through how you use it to zoom in, and you should be able to work out the rest from there.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Set the playhead at the start of the chosen clip. This is where you want the zoom effect to start from.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Click to select the effects menu. It should be at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Seek out the scale and position tools. You can use these to size your animation, decide how much of a zoom you like, and how fast it will go.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/scale-and-position-final-cut.jpg"
                      alt="scale and position"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – Follow keyframe &gt; size &gt; position and ensure your clip is covered as you need it. You can always come back to this step a few times if you don’t get it immediately right.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> – Set the playhead where you want the clip and animation to end. Remember – if you zoom or pan too fast, you might glitch in your footage. Do it on time for the best results.</p>
<p><strong>As a Pro Tip</strong>: you will be baled to view all keyframes on your clip if you select show video animation from your timeline.</p>
<h2 id="The-Ken-Burns-Conclusion-2"><a href="#The-Ken-Burns-Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="The Ken Burns Conclusion"></a>The Ken Burns Conclusion</h2><p>The Ken Burns Effect is famous for a reason. It allows you to fill up space if you don’t have footage for certain things. It can be used to depict ancient battles without the use of CGI.</p>
<p>The Ken Burns Effect, Final Cut Pro (X) technique lets filmmakers go to places that they wouldn’t otherwise get to. It is excellent for both glimpsing into the past, and for flashing forward into imagined futures. Best of all, it lets you go there when you aren’t a big-budget Hollywood film producer. We love anything that saves a buck or two while we edit.</p>

<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10"></a>Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10</h2><p>Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs. You should also check a player’s compatibility with the operating system you have installed on your computer and that you have all the codecs necessary to play ISO and other image, audio and video file format. So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.</p>
<h3 id="1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan"><a href="#1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan" class="headerlink" title="1. VLC Media Player by VideoLan"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.videolan.org/" >VLC Media Player by VideoLan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Over the course of the last two decades, VLC has established itself as one of the most versatile media players ever created. This cross-platform app can be used on Macs, PCs, Linux computers and Smartphones to play different types of audio, image and video files. In fact, VLC is probably the most reliable <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >DVD player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can find, as it allows you to play DVD and Blu-ray discs effortlessly. However, if you want to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >watch videos in 4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or 8K resolution, you must install the VLC 3.0 Vetinari update of the media player.</p>
<p>What’s more, playing a DVD or a Blu-ray with VLC is a simple task you can complete in just a few clicks. The Open Disc option that is located in the player’s Media menu enables you to choose if you would like to open a DVD, VCD, Audio CD or Blu-ray disc. Moreover, you won’t need to install additional  or MPEG-4 codecs, since VLC can play the vast majority of video files regardless of the codec they are using.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Available to all PC and Mac users for free</li>
<li>The most versatile media player on the market</li>
<li>Offers basic video editing options</li>

Besides providing support for all commonly used video file formats and allowing you to play DVDs, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Blu-rays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or audio CDs, PotPlayer also offers support for different types of 3D glasses. This Windows-based media player is equipped with enhanced H&#x2F;W Acceleration technology that enables the software to assist the CPU and GPU during the playback of demanding video files.</p>
<p>PotPlayer has all the codecs that are required for the playback of various types of multimedia files, so you don’t have to waste time searching for the codec packs that make possible playing video and audio content that is stored on DVDs or Blu-rays. The media player lets you choose a sound card in case you have more just than one and it supports SRT and SMI, VOB and Blu-ray subtitles.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full OpenCodec support</li>

<li>Enables users to bookmark chapters</li>
<li>Compatible with TV, DVD and HDTV devices</li>

However, the free version of BlazeDVD doesn’t allow you to open region coded DVDs and Blu-rays or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add subtitles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to your files. So if you want to gain access to all the features this DVD player has to offer, you must make a one-time payment of $49.96 and upgrade to its Pro version. Both versions of BlazeDVD let you play DVDs, VCDs or SVCDs and allow you to choose between different playback modes.</p>
<p>The Surround Sound support enhances the audio playback and provides a theater-like experience to the viewers. Moreover, you can choose between ten audio filters you can apply to media files you open with BlazeDVD or use the Parental Control feature if you want to restrict the access to violent content to your children. Creating slideshows from still images or recording videos in an MPEG2 file format are also among the options you are going to have at your disposal if you opt for the paid version of BlazeDVD.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent audio playback capabilities</li>
<li>Features a learning mode</li>
<li>Equipped with the Smart Stretch technology</li>
<li>Multi-core CPU acceleration features enhance the video and audio playback</li>

                ></p>
<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

                ></p>
<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

                ></p>
<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars.

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

                ></p>
<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>Developed as video editing software that has been developed by Apple, Final Cut Pro began life as software designed to made simple video editing accessible for video hobbyists and independent filmmakers. However, in recent years the capabilities of Final Cut Pro have evolved significantly and we are now seeing major Hollywood movies also being edited with this software.</p>

                      alt="Movie made by FCP - the social network"
                ></p>
<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

                      alt="Movie made by FCP - The girl with dragon tattoo"
                ></p>
<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

                ></p>
<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

                ></p>
<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>
