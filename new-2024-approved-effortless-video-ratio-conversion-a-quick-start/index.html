If you are using Filmora, you do not need to crack it in order to get <strong>Filmora free</strong>. You can earn the Filmora license by doing the mission of exporting three videos in total from the software. The method is quite simple and easy, but the mission is only available for Filmora 10.2 and above versions for a limited time. And the mission may be taken down sometime.</p>
<p>In order to do so, you have to follow the steps mentioned below.</p>

<ul>
<li>To begin with, you need to download and install Filmora, and then launch Filmora and then click New Project to create a new project. Then you will see a pop-up window as shown below:</li>
</ul>
<p><img

<p>Now, it’s time to import, edit and export video footage with Filmora. There are several ways to import media to Filmora, and the direct way is drag and drop the photo and video into the Project media library, and then place them in order in the timeline.</p>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>If you need to cut out some clips from the footage, you can trim, split, or crop it easily. Right-click the footage in the timeline, and you will find the most commonly used editing tools.</li>
<li>You can follow the software layout to add audio, titles, transitions, effects, elements accordingly. If you wish to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add sound to your video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, go to “Audio” tab, find the proper music track or sound effect for your footage, and then drag it to the soundtrack in the timeline.</li>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>The titles tab provides hundreds of titles and texts templates, including openers, titles, Lower 3rds, subtitles, and end credits. You can also use the Plain text template without animations and add some callouts.</li>
<li>In the next step, add overlays or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >transitions in your video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and if you have finished the editing, press Ctrl+S to save the project.</li>
