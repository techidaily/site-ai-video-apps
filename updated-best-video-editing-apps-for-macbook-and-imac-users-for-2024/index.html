<p>Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.</p>
<p>Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to <strong>add text</strong>, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can <strong>rotate, crop and auto enhance</strong> videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap <strong>Revert</strong> to restore to the original version.</p>
<p>If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can <strong>adjust the focus points and the depth of the field</strong> in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo’s time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Themes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.</p>
<h3 id="2-QuickTime-Player-3"><a href="#2-QuickTime-Player-3" class="headerlink" title="2. QuickTime Player"></a>2. QuickTime Player</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals. However, we would lean more towards beginners because most professionals today prefer apps like iMovie or Final Cut Pro. But that’s not to say this one doesn’t have excellent features to offer.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with QuickTime Player App?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trim, Combine,</strong> <strong>Rotate, Split MOV Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone wants to make their lengthy videos short. QuickTime allows you to do precisely that with its trimming feature. Make your videos short and catchy with this feature. Further, you can combine two videos to make one excellent video for your presentation. The app also allows you to split different videos and combine them to produce more quality content.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Record Screen and Voiceover</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you think your video footage can do well with a background voiceover of someone else, QuickTime Player allows you to record your audios in the background while your video plays smoothly. You can also record the desktop screen with the Player.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shrink Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe your video looks better with a small size in appearance, try shrinking it using the shrink feature in the QuickTime Player. You can lower the video quality from 1080p, 720p to whatever your phone or Mac storage deems compatible.</p>
<h3 id="3-Clips-3"><a href="#3-Clips-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Clips"></a>3. Clips</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to Use</p>
<p>You might not have heard of Clips as much as you may have heard about the others on this list. But don’t sleep on this one. Clips have slowly but surely gained the attraction of expert video editors, and you’d see almost all of them having Clips on their iPhones or Macs.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Clips?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Clips is interesting to check out when you’re an iOS fan. You can use this free video editing app to record and edit 16:9, 4:3 or square videos with various camera effects, stunning filters, animated text, music, emoji, stickers, and more, and then share it with your friends or family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family-Oriented</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips is mainly oriented towards families and children, and it isn’t even close to the capabilities of iMovie. Nonetheless, it is moving closer to be a genuine video editing program with each new version.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AR Spaces</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips, for instance, introduced AR Spaces, an augmented reality function for iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro owners, in April.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the most recent version in September enables you to import and edit video shot in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 and ProRes footage from the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max.</p>
<h3 id="4-iMovie-3"><a href="#4-iMovie-3" class="headerlink" title="4. iMovie"></a>4. iMovie</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPadOS&#x2F;macOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>One of the most recognizable apps in the Apple market for video editing software is the iMovie app. Almost all professional experts are reaping the benefits of using the iMovie app. The app developers have emphasized greatly equipping the professionals and the newbies who so desperately want to make their mark into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with iMovie?</strong></p>
<p>iMovie, is more like Final Cut Pro X’s younger sibling. But it’s free with your Mac, so there’s no danger in giving it a shot. It’s an excellent option for newcomers learning to use editing software, casual enthusiasts, and even YouTubers who wish to cut up their films.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Merge, Cut, Trim: Pull off Everything!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Although iMovie is rather simple, this may be considered a benefit for inexperienced editors. You can combine, cut, and rearrange your original video and audio with iMovie.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4K Video Editing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You may even export your work in 4K quality at up to 60 frames per second once you’ve done it. Many effects, transitions, filters, and fine-tuning settings for white balance, color matching, and audio isolation are also included.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In September, iMovie received a major upgrade, which included importing and editing footage taken in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 to Macs. You may now add, tweak, and delete focus points, as well as change the depths of field effect in a video shot in Cinematic mode, assuming you have a modern iPhone or iPad.</p>

<p>A Square Video is the one that has the same width and height while a vertical video is taller than it is wide. A vertical video or a square video is presented in the form of a landscape. A square video has an aspect ratio of 1:1 while a vertical video has an aspect ratio of 9:16.So, in a vertical video, the <strong>horizontal video size</strong> is less than its vertical size.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>Why Vertical Video is Dominating</strong></p>
<p>It would not be wrong to say that the world has taken a mobile route and with this, the dominance of vertical videos can be seen. As per the studies it has been found that around 75% of the video playback across the globe are from mobile phones and around 94% of the time, the phones are held vertically. These figures completely state the need for the hour-vertical videos.</p>
<p>With users holding their mobile phones vertically the majority of the time, the dominance of the vertical videos is no surprise.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>Benefits of Square and Vertical Videos</strong></p>
<p>There are several benefits of having square and vertical videos. These videos are specifically</p>
<p>designed for mobile phones and thus they can be easily posted on multiple social media sites without any need for change or editing. Other benefits of using vertical videos are their ease of recording through a mobile phone. Vertical videos are beneficial even for the advertisers and promoters as they help them reach more audiences and prospective customers through social media sites and other sites.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Vertical-Videos-Are-Displayed"><a href="#Part-2-How-Vertical-Videos-Are-Displayed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Vertical Videos Are Displayed"></a>Part 2 How Vertical Videos Are Displayed</h2><p>Vertical videos are majorly displayed on mobile devices as smartphones are used vertically most of the time. The width of these videos is less as compared to their height and this makes them appear fit on the smartphone’s screen. Moreover, using the s<strong>creen aspect ratio calculator</strong>, you can further decide upon the aspect ratio depending on the size of the device screen on which video has to be played.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-What’s-the-Best-Tip-to-Resize-social-media-Vertical-Video-Ratio"><a href="#Part-3-What’s-the-Best-Tip-to-Resize-social-media-Vertical-Video-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 What’s the Best Tip to Resize social media Vertical Video Ratio?"></a>Part 3 What’s the Best Tip to Resize social media Vertical Video Ratio?</h2><p>Listed below are the tips for resizing the social media vertical video ratio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learn about the Aspect Ratios</strong></p>
<p>A vertical video is taller than it is wide. Thus, any video that is taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio will be termed a vertical video. The commonly used aspect ratio is 9:16 that uses the complete vertical screen. So, to capture a vertical video, use the camera in portrait mode or edit it as per the vertical aspect ratio. There are also <strong>TV aspect ratio calculator</strong> tools that can be used for the task.</p>

                      alt="Learn About Aspect Ratio"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Screen splitting</p>
<p>Multiple clips that are horizontal can be placed at the top of each other for a vertical frame as it is tall. The stacking can be done for the related clips or to make them appear as one. Place the clips creatively using patterns or lines.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Screen Splitting"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Filling the vertical space</p>
<p>If needed, you can creatively fill the vertical space when the shot is not a close one. One of the ideas is by raising the camera of your phone high and then moving it down that will give a deep frame. You can also fill up the vertical space below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-4.jpg"
                      alt="Filling Vertical Space"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Side-to-side fast movements must be avoided</p>
<p>Since the width area in the vertical videos is less, it is also better to avoid the fast side-to-side movement as it will create a shaky and blurry effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-5.jpg"
                      alt="Avoid Side To Side Fast Movements"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make use of text and graphics</p>
<p>To complement videos, using text and graphics is a good option. Use the vertical space smartly and include text, stickers, graphics, and other content for enhancing the video and its meaning.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Use Text and Graphics"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Grab attention</p>
<p>It is important for the videos on the social media sites to instantly catch the attention of the viewers, else they will move on to the next one. So, ensure that your vertical videos are eye-catchy and interesting with bright colors, looping animations, GIFs, and other content that is likely to hook up the viewers.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Grab Attention"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rule of Thirds</p>
<p>As per the photography rule of thirds, the main subject is not to be placed at the center and instead it the entire frame is divided into thirds using imaginary horizontal and vertical lines. The subject should be placed on these lines or where the lines meet. Use the guide grid on your phone’s camera to use this rule.</p>

<p>A Square Video is the one that has the same width and height while a vertical video is taller than it is wide. A vertical video or a square video is presented in the form of a landscape. A square video has an aspect ratio of 1:1 while a vertical video has an aspect ratio of 9:16.So, in a vertical video, the <strong>horizontal video size</strong> is less than its vertical size.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>Why Vertical Video is Dominating</strong></p>
<p>It would not be wrong to say that the world has taken a mobile route and with this, the dominance of vertical videos can be seen. As per the studies it has been found that around 75% of the video playback across the globe are from mobile phones and around 94% of the time, the phones are held vertically. These figures completely state the need for the hour-vertical videos.</p>
<p>With users holding their mobile phones vertically the majority of the time, the dominance of the vertical videos is no surprise.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>Benefits of Square and Vertical Videos</strong></p>
<p>There are several benefits of having square and vertical videos. These videos are specifically</p>
<p>designed for mobile phones and thus they can be easily posted on multiple social media sites without any need for change or editing. Other benefits of using vertical videos are their ease of recording through a mobile phone. Vertical videos are beneficial even for the advertisers and promoters as they help them reach more audiences and prospective customers through social media sites and other sites.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Vertical-Videos-Are-Displayed-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Vertical-Videos-Are-Displayed-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Vertical Videos Are Displayed"></a>Part 2 How Vertical Videos Are Displayed</h2><p>Vertical videos are majorly displayed on mobile devices as smartphones are used vertically most of the time. The width of these videos is less as compared to their height and this makes them appear fit on the smartphone’s screen. Moreover, using the s<strong>creen aspect ratio calculator</strong>, you can further decide upon the aspect ratio depending on the size of the device screen on which video has to be played.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-What’s-the-Best-Tip-to-Resize-social-media-Vertical-Video-Ratio-3"><a href="#Part-3-What’s-the-Best-Tip-to-Resize-social-media-Vertical-Video-Ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 What’s the Best Tip to Resize social media Vertical Video Ratio?"></a>Part 3 What’s the Best Tip to Resize social media Vertical Video Ratio?</h2><p>Listed below are the tips for resizing the social media vertical video ratio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learn about the Aspect Ratios</strong></p>
<p>A vertical video is taller than it is wide. Thus, any video that is taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio will be termed a vertical video. The commonly used aspect ratio is 9:16 that uses the complete vertical screen. So, to capture a vertical video, use the camera in portrait mode or edit it as per the vertical aspect ratio. There are also <strong>TV aspect ratio calculator</strong> tools that can be used for the task.</p>

                      alt="Learn About Aspect Ratio"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Screen splitting</p>
<p>Multiple clips that are horizontal can be placed at the top of each other for a vertical frame as it is tall. The stacking can be done for the related clips or to make them appear as one. Place the clips creatively using patterns or lines.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Screen Splitting"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Filling the vertical space</p>
<p>If needed, you can creatively fill the vertical space when the shot is not a close one. One of the ideas is by raising the camera of your phone high and then moving it down that will give a deep frame. You can also fill up the vertical space below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Filling Vertical Space"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Side-to-side fast movements must be avoided</p>
<p>Since the width area in the vertical videos is less, it is also better to avoid the fast side-to-side movement as it will create a shaky and blurry effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-5.jpg"
                      alt="Avoid Side To Side Fast Movements"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make use of text and graphics</p>
<p>To complement videos, using text and graphics is a good option. Use the vertical space smartly and include text, stickers, graphics, and other content for enhancing the video and its meaning.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Use Text and Graphics"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Grab attention</p>
<p>It is important for the videos on the social media sites to instantly catch the attention of the viewers, else they will move on to the next one. So, ensure that your vertical videos are eye-catchy and interesting with bright colors, looping animations, GIFs, and other content that is likely to hook up the viewers.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Grab Attention"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rule of Thirds</p>
<p>As per the photography rule of thirds, the main subject is not to be placed at the center and instead it the entire frame is divided into thirds using imaginary horizontal and vertical lines. The subject should be placed on these lines or where the lines meet. Use the guide grid on your phone’s camera to use this rule.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Rule of Thirds"
                ></p>

<p>Reversing is also one of the popular options on TikTok and it can be readily performed even without deeper knowledge of video production and editing. Here is how you can do it effectively, either with built-in tools provided by TikTok or with additional pieces of software.</p>

In fact, there is a dedicated function you can use to reverse your video instantly and without leaving the app.</p>
<p>To activate this function, you need to click on the Effects button at the bottom of the screen and then select the Time effects category. The reverse option can be found in this menu, and it will change the direction of the entire clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

The entire process lasts just a few seconds and doesn’t require any technical skills, so anyone can take advantage of this simple effect to create exciting videos that play with the concept of time and resonate with the online audience.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Play-Someone-Else’s-Video-in-Reverse-on-TikTok"><a href="#How-to-Play-Someone-Else’s-Video-in-Reverse-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Someone Else’s Video in Reverse on TikTok?"></a>How to Play Someone Else’s Video in Reverse on TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok only allows video authors to reverse their own videos if they want, but viewers can’t just watch the videos they see online backwards. They are limited to straightforward viewing, although it is possible to jump forward to any part of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Reverse Vid for iOS"
                ></p>
<p>The only solution to this limitation involves external playback tools, so if you really want to watch a certain video in reverse you could try to download it to your phone and use a different video player. For example, iPhone owners can pick up a third-party app like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reverse-vid-play-it-backwards/id950551948" >Reverse Vid <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the App Store that lets them use reverse playback. Once the app is installed and the video is stored on the phone, there is nothing preventing the user from watching it backwards on the mobile screen.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Reverse-A-Video-on-CupCut-And-Share-It-on-TikTok"><a href="#How-to-Reverse-A-Video-on-CupCut-And-Share-It-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="How to Reverse A Video on CupCut And Share It on TikTok?"></a>How to Reverse A Video on CupCut And Share It on TikTok?</h2><p>Users who know a bit more about video editing and want more control over the final product can use external tools instead of TikTok’s own function. There are many video editors for TikTok that could do the trick, but CupCut is one of the simplest apps that will work from your phone and can be downloaded for free.</p>
<p>In CupCut, you can precisely select the part of the video you want to reverse and even adjust playback speed if you want. That gives you more creative freedom and unlocks the possibility to attempt more ambitious visual ideas.</p>
<p>Of course, once you reverse the video in CupCut you will need to export it to TikTok before you can share it with your contacts. Since both of those apps support the same video formats, this process should run very smoothly and without any compatibility issues.</p>
<h2 id="Is-It-Possible-to-Reverse-Video-and-Audio-at-The-Same-Time"><a href="#Is-It-Possible-to-Reverse-Video-and-Audio-at-The-Same-Time" class="headerlink" title="Is It Possible to Reverse Video and Audio at The Same Time?"></a>Is It Possible to Reverse Video and Audio at The Same Time?</h2><p>In some cases, reversing the audio stream could make the video even more impressive but unfortunately, TikTok doesn’t directly support this possibility. However, more <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >advanced editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suits give you the option to have both video and audio run backwards in unison. For example, you can use <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for this purpose and accomplish the task in several easy steps.</p>
<p>First, you need to set up the project to 9:16 <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since the video will be shared on TikTok. And then you can import the video footage to Filmora.</p>
<p>To reverse the video and audio at the same time, right-click the clip in the timeline and then select <strong>Speed and Duration</strong>. In the Custom Speed window, check the <strong>Reverse Speed</strong> option and click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</p>
<p>Play the clip and you will find the video and audio is reversed at the same time.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to reverse the audio, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >detach the audio from the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> first and then reverse the video separately.</p>
<p>When you complete these steps, you are ready to export the video and re-import the reversed clip back into TikTok.</p>
