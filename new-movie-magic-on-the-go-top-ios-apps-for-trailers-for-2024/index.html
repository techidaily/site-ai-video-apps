Its auto-sync feature allows you to adjust audio with video and present your footage realistically and creatively. Similarly, users can create Multicam clips and include multiple clips at any given angle with the FCPX.</p>

<p>The audio and video out of sync is a common issue faced by most Final Cut Pro X users. They experience an audio delay in their edited video that gives a bad impression and haunts the user experience.</p>
<p>Whenever you face an out-of-sync problem, don’t assume that the clips in your sequence are also out of sync. Multiple factors can cause sync issues, the most prominent one is by an over-taxing of the processor when it tries to run the program at its maximum. Consequently, the overstressed processer fails to sync audio and video accordingly and causes a delay.</p>

<p>If you are experiencing an audio and video sync problem due to an over-taxing of your computer’s processor, follow these steps to relieve processor stress and solve your problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the Canvas size to “Fit Window”</li>
<li>Prevent the Canvas and Viewer from overlapping</li>
<li>Use an updated, fast, and consistent hard drive that meets the minimum software requirements of Final Cut Pro X</li>
<li>Set the control panel resolution must be to 75A Hz or higher</li>
<li>Do not select too many real-time audio tracks</li>
<li>Turn off the Mirror to Desktop option</li>
<li>Avoid opening multiple sequences simultaneously</li>
<li>Render the video sequence to a single file.</li>
</ul>

Its auto-sync feature automatically analyzes the audio and video clips selected in your timeline and allows you to sync video with audio.</p>
<p>To use this feature, use multiple audio and video clips recorded from different resources during the same take. Once you have selected, Final Cut Pro will automatically start analyzing the clips for sync points like date of file creation, markers, audio content, and time code, etc. After analyzing the clips, the syncing process will begin in which these audio and video clips will be synced together into a new clip without affecting the original clip. Even if your clips do not have any sync points, Final Cut Pro X will sync them at their respective starting points.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Users can also use custom settings for an advanced syncing process by adjusting different parameters according to their preferences. The following section explains the manual syncing process of audio and video clips in Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p>This way, you can sync Multicam using audio in the Final Cut Pro X. To verify or adjust the sync, open the Multicam clip in the Angle Editor and drag it to the left or right. For single-frame adjustment, you can use the comma&#x2F;period keys, while the left&#x2F;right angle bracket is used for 10-frame adjustments.</p>
<p>Sync can be pretty easy with handy editing tools, like final cut pro, or Filmora, a much friendlier editor for beginners. Learn more about sync in the video below.</p>

You can make Multicam clips with diverse media sources and include as many clips in any given angle as you want. Make sure you have labeled your clips with a camera name or an angle to make Final Cut Pro X sync Multicam properly. You can even name all the clips shot by one camera in a single step.</p>

<li>Go to <strong>Preferences &gt; Import &gt; Keywords</strong> and set the Finder Tags to label the imported clips and set the shots apart from the filenames.</li>
<li>In the FCPX menu, go to <strong>View &gt; Browser &gt; Toggle Filmstrip&#x2F;List View</strong> for setting the Event Browser to List View. (You can also use the command OPT+CMD+2).</li>
<li>If some of your clips have an incorrect time of day, you should adjust them first. Hence, select those clips and click <strong>Modify &gt; Adjust Content Created Date and Time.</strong></li>
<li>In the Event Browser, select multiple clips captured with one camera or audio recorder.</li>
<li>Press CMD+4 to show the Inspector, click the “i” button, and verify the clip’s information like camera name, etc.</li>
<li>Give a specific camera name to the selected clips and press return and repeat the process for each audio recorder and camera.</li>
<li>In the Event Browser, select multiple clips that need to be synced. Right-click on these clips and select the “Synchronize Clips” or “New Multicam Clip” option.</li>
<li>Click the checkbox “Use Audio for Synchronization” to sync audio.</li>
</ul>

<p>The audio and video out of sync is a common issue faced by most Final Cut Pro X users. They experience an audio delay in their edited video that gives a bad impression and haunts the user experience.</p>
<p>Whenever you face an out-of-sync problem, don’t assume that the clips in your sequence are also out of sync. Multiple factors can cause sync issues, the most prominent one is by an over-taxing of the processor when it tries to run the program at its maximum. Consequently, the overstressed processer fails to sync audio and video accordingly and causes a delay.</p>

Its auto-sync feature automatically analyzes the audio and video clips selected in your timeline and allows you to sync video with audio.</p>
<p>To use this feature, use multiple audio and video clips recorded from different resources during the same take. Once you have selected, Final Cut Pro will automatically start analyzing the clips for sync points like date of file creation, markers, audio content, and time code, etc. After analyzing the clips, the syncing process will begin in which these audio and video clips will be synced together into a new clip without affecting the original clip. Even if your clips do not have any sync points, Final Cut Pro X will sync them at their respective starting points.</p>

<p>The audio and video out of sync is a common issue faced by most Final Cut Pro X users. They experience an audio delay in their edited video that gives a bad impression and haunts the user experience.</p>
<p>Whenever you face an out-of-sync problem, don’t assume that the clips in your sequence are also out of sync. Multiple factors can cause sync issues, the most prominent one is by an over-taxing of the processor when it tries to run the program at its maximum. Consequently, the overstressed processer fails to sync audio and video accordingly and causes a delay.</p>

Its auto-sync feature automatically analyzes the audio and video clips selected in your timeline and allows you to sync video with audio.</p>
<p>To use this feature, use multiple audio and video clips recorded from different resources during the same take. Once you have selected, Final Cut Pro will automatically start analyzing the clips for sync points like date of file creation, markers, audio content, and time code, etc. After analyzing the clips, the syncing process will begin in which these audio and video clips will be synced together into a new clip without affecting the original clip. Even if your clips do not have any sync points, Final Cut Pro X will sync them at their respective starting points.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="dorp-window"
                ></p>
<p>Users can also use custom settings for an advanced syncing process by adjusting different parameters according to their preferences. The following section explains the manual syncing process of audio and video clips in Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p>This way, you can sync Multicam using audio in the Final Cut Pro X. To verify or adjust the sync, open the Multicam clip in the Angle Editor and drag it to the left or right. For single-frame adjustment, you can use the comma&#x2F;period keys, while the left&#x2F;right angle bracket is used for 10-frame adjustments.</p>
<p>Sync can be pretty easy with handy editing tools, like final cut pro, or Filmora, a much friendlier editor for beginners. Learn more about sync in the video below.</p>

<li>In the Event Browser, select multiple clips captured with one camera or audio recorder.</li>
<li>Press CMD+4 to show the Inspector, click the “i” button, and verify the clip’s information like camera name, etc.</li>
