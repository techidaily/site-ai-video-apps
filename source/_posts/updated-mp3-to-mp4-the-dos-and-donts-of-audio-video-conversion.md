Keeping in mind that there will of course be no actual imagery to go with the finished product (unless you choose to add as such), converting an **MP3 into MP4** is very easy!

There are even online **MP3 to MP4 converters** that will allow you to do this without having to download or install anything! But, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. Continue reading below to learn more:

02 [Six Online and Free Mp3 to Mp4 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **Easy Steps on Convert MP3 into MP4**

For the first part of this article, we'll be covering how to use a **free** **MP3 to MP4 converter** in order to successfully change the format of your audio into a video file! There will be two examples given for this, one for the straightforward **MP3 into MP4** conversion the other for the more specified **MP3 to MOV** conversion!

### 01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?

**Step 1: Launch MP3 to MP4 Convert (for Windows)**

For our example, we'll be using the **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, EaseUS Video Converter! This is open-source software, so you can use it for free!

To start using your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, upload the file that you want to convert! For our example converter, it's as simple as dragging and dropping your chosen MP3 into the interface (as pointed out in the image below.)

![Launch MP3 to MP4 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%201.png)

**Step 2: Choose Output Format!**

Once the MP3 file has been uploaded, choose your desired output format.

(For our example **MP3 to MP4 converter**, this means selecting the settings icon for the file in question and then choosing a format from the pop-up window that appears (shown in the image below).

![Choose MP4 Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%202.png)

**Step 3: Start Converting!**

Once you've chosen your desired output format (which in this case is **MP3 into MP4**), select the "CONVERT" button to finish up!

![Convert MP3 into MP4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%203.png)

**Step 4: Save MP3 Into MP4**

Depending on your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, your new MP4 file may have to be downloaded manually or not.

In the case of EaseUS Video Converter, it is downloaded automatically, all you have to do is select the "Finished" tab and select "OPEN" to go directly to the file location.

![Open Finished MP4 File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%204.png)

### 02How to Convert MP3 to MOV?

We've also included how you can convert **MP3 to MOV** with the same tool! As you will surely see, much of the process is the same. Only one step is really changed!

**Step 1: Uploaded MP3 File!**

First, just like in the previous section, upload your MP3 file (by dragging and dropping the file onto the **MP3 to MOV** converter.)

![Choose Files for Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%205.png)

**Step 2: Select 'MOV' Format!**

This is the step where things change, of course! Now, rather than choosing MP4, you should select the "MOV" format for your output type! This will ensure that your MP3 file is converted specifically to a MOV file.

![Select MOV output format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%206.png)

**Step 3: Convert!**

Again, just like before, select "CONVERT" to start the conversion process from **MP3 to MOV**!

![Select Conver or Convert All](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%207.png)

**Step 4: Open Folder to Find File!**

Then, finally, go to the "Finished" tab to find your new MOV file.

## Part 2 **Six Online and Free Mp3 to Mp4 Converter**

For this next section, we're going to introduce a couple of **online MP3 to MP4 converters** as well other general, paid, and **free MP3 to MP4 converters** that you can check out. A link to a video showing how the converter works, as well as brief descriptions for each converter, have also been provided to ensure that you have a good idea of how each one works!

### 01**[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first of the tools on this list is Filmora! Filmora, first and foremost, is an advanced video editor. Some might say that using it as a tool to simply convert **MP3 into MP4** is a little bit of an overkill.

But, chances are, you're not likely going to want to stop at converting your MP3 into an MP4 file anyway, right? Well, if that's the case, then having an all-in-one tool on your side that can offer you endless options for all sorts of purposes is one way to ensure that you are starting off on the right foot from the very beginning!

### 02Zamzar

Zamzar is a Windows 10 app that works as a general conversion tool. It doesn't just convert **MP3 into MP4** or **MP3 into MOV** — it also does the job if you're looking for a converter that will work on JPG to PNG or PDF to JPG, etc. That makes it a helpful tool to have on hand just for general conversion purposes.

### 03Online File Converter

Online File Converter, as you can probably guess from the name, is an online conversion tool! This tool, much like Zamzar, is a heavy-hitter when it comes to conversion inputs and outputs compatibility. So, not only are you able to do the general **MP3 into MP4** conversion promised today, but you can do other things as well! Plus, no download or installation is required! All you need is an internet connection to access the website the converter is on and a little patience while you wait to upload, convert, and download the file in question.

### 04Any Conv

AnyConv is an alternate to the Online File Converter if you're looking for an online solution, but you don't like the interface of one or the other. The two are pretty much identical in terms of features. All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you're done!

### 05Uniconverter

Uniconverter is an online **MP3 to MP4** tool from Wondershare (the same creators of Filmora Pro). It's a very solid tool. And it's quite a convenient one too. Since, just like any online converter, all you need to start using it is an internet connection.

### 06MConverter - Chrome Extension

Our last pick brings us back to unique solutions! Specifically, we're delving into the realm of Chrome extensions! This tool, the MConverter, works similarly to the other converters on this list. But, of course, in this case, if you want to use it in order to convert your files, you must first download the plug-in to your Chrome browser!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Despite the variety of options out there for **MP3 into MP4** converters, they all pretty much work the same. First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!

**●** Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your **MP3 to MOV** instead — that's possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert **MP4 to MP3**, that works too!

**●** The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.

Depending on your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, your new MP4 file may have to be downloaded manually or not.

In the case of EaseUS Video Converter, it is downloaded automatically, all you have to do is select the "Finished" tab and select "OPEN" to go directly to the file location.

### 02How to Convert MP3 to MOV?

We've also included how you can convert **MP3 to MOV** with the same tool! As you will surely see, much of the process is the same. Only one step is really changed!

**Step 1: Uploaded MP3 File!**

First, just like in the previous section, upload your MP3 file (by dragging and dropping the file onto the **MP3 to MOV** converter.)

![Choose Files for Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%205.png)

**Step 2: Select 'MOV' Format!**

This is the step where things change, of course! Now, rather than choosing MP4, you should select the "MOV" format for your output type! This will ensure that your MP3 file is converted specifically to a MOV file.

![Select MOV output format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%206.png)

**Step 3: Convert!**

Again, just like before, select "CONVERT" to start the conversion process from **MP3 to MOV**!

![Select Conver or Convert All](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%207.png)

**Step 4: Open Folder to Find File!**

Then, finally, go to the "Finished" tab to find your new MOV file.

## Part 2 **Six Online and Free Mp3 to Mp4 Converter**

For this next section, we're going to introduce a couple of **online MP3 to MP4 converters** as well other general, paid, and **free MP3 to MP4 converters** that you can check out. A link to a video showing how the converter works, as well as brief descriptions for each converter, have also been provided to ensure that you have a good idea of how each one works!

### 01**[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first of the tools on this list is Filmora! Filmora, first and foremost, is an advanced video editor. Some might say that using it as a tool to simply convert **MP3 into MP4** is a little bit of an overkill.

But, chances are, you're not likely going to want to stop at converting your MP3 into an MP4 file anyway, right? Well, if that's the case, then having an all-in-one tool on your side that can offer you endless options for all sorts of purposes is one way to ensure that you are starting off on the right foot from the very beginning!

### 02Zamzar

Zamzar is a Windows 10 app that works as a general conversion tool. It doesn't just convert **MP3 into MP4** or **MP3 into MOV** — it also does the job if you're looking for a converter that will work on JPG to PNG or PDF to JPG, etc. That makes it a helpful tool to have on hand just for general conversion purposes.

### 03Online File Converter

Online File Converter, as you can probably guess from the name, is an online conversion tool! This tool, much like Zamzar, is a heavy-hitter when it comes to conversion inputs and outputs compatibility. So, not only are you able to do the general **MP3 into MP4** conversion promised today, but you can do other things as well! Plus, no download or installation is required! All you need is an internet connection to access the website the converter is on and a little patience while you wait to upload, convert, and download the file in question.

### 04Any Conv

AnyConv is an alternate to the Online File Converter if you're looking for an online solution, but you don't like the interface of one or the other. The two are pretty much identical in terms of features. All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you're done!

### 05Uniconverter

Uniconverter is an online **MP3 to MP4** tool from Wondershare (the same creators of Filmora Pro). It's a very solid tool. And it's quite a convenient one too. Since, just like any online converter, all you need to start using it is an internet connection.

### 06MConverter - Chrome Extension

Our last pick brings us back to unique solutions! Specifically, we're delving into the realm of Chrome extensions! This tool, the MConverter, works similarly to the other converters on this list. But, of course, in this case, if you want to use it in order to convert your files, you must first download the plug-in to your Chrome browser!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Despite the variety of options out there for **MP3 into MP4** converters, they all pretty much work the same. First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!

**●** Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your **MP3 to MOV** instead — that's possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert **MP4 to MP3**, that works too!

**●** The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.

_Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?_ Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.

In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.

* [Section 1\. Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality](#why-trim-vlc-loss-quality)
* [Section 2\. Video editor to trim VLC videos without loss of quality](#software-trim-vlc-without-loss-quality)

## Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?

To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!

#### 1\. Codec

Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.

#### 2\. Container

A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.

Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.

#### 3\. Video compression and re-encoding

You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.

When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. **Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.**

The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.

When you make changes to a video with a **video trimmer app**, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.

## Section 2.  The software you can use to trim VLC videos without loss of quality

Filmora is a powerful [video editor for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Windows. It is a good choice to trim VLC video. You can cut and combine videos without losing the quality. Filmora supports pretty much every video format there is, so you don't have to worry about codecs and containers.

If you’re working with a long video, you can take advantage of Filmora unique feature called “Scene Detection.” With this feature, the software will automatically detect scene changes in the VLC video and separate them, making it easy for you to trim it into multiple clips. If you want to trim your video manually, you can just drag the trimming sliders according to how you want to cut the video.

It is user-friendlier than Filmora – all you have to do is drag your video to the software and then you can start trimming it by using the Arrow symbols.

![lossescut for trimming VLC video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/lossescut.jpg)

One unique feature of LosslessCut is that it lets you take JPEG screenshots of the video. It also has a portable version that doesn’t require any installation and can be started directly from a USB.

* Pros: LosslessCut works best with mobile videos or action cams like GoPro.
* Cons: It supports a whole range of video formats, but don’t expect to edit 4K videos using this software. It’s simple and easy to use for a reason.

### 3. Trimming VLC via [TunesKit Video Converter](https://www.tuneskit.com/video-cutter-for-win.html)

TunesKit is a simple video trimmer software that’s available on both Mac and Windows. Unlike Filmora and LosslessCut, TunesKit supports a very limited number of video formats. It is mainly an MP4 video cutter. It works at a much faster speed and there is no loss of quality.

![tuneskit to trim vlc video without lossing quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/tuneskit.jpg)

TunesKit also has a video editor, which lets you add effects to different segments of the trimmed video, a feature that you probably won’t be using very often. To trim VLC videos in MP4 without re-encoding, you simply have to drag the slider that appears when you import your video.
* Cons: However, its functions may not be as rich as Filmora.

#### Conclusion

If you trim your VLC video, it will result in data loss, which will lead to a reduction in quality. Losing quality is inevitable with most video editors, which is why you should [Download Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as it's easy to use and has the best and most useful features.

Filmora supports many popular formats like MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and also different screen resolutions so no matter what the format of your VLC video is, you can easily divide it by scenes using the Scene Detection feature and quickly turn those scenes into clips.
