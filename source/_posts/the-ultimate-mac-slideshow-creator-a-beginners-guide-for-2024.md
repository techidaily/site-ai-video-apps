Wondershare Filmora is a photo video maker for Mac features a stylish interface and handy editing tools.

It provides a media browser for you to import all your local video, audio, or still images conveniently. Only by drag-and-drop, you can arrange and organize the videos for easy editing.

All video editing is based on Timeline, which lets you edit the video & audio comfortably. Also, it provides a side-by-side previewing window. What you see is what you get.

Besides all common editing tools like crop, rotate, trim, split, add voiceover and background music, Ezivd for Mac also enables you to touch up videos by an extensive list of fabulous video edits.

For example, you can apply Mosaic to hide personal or copyrighted info, create a close-up to stand out from the crowd, adjust the playing speed like 2x faster to make fun. Let alone picking up your favorite effects from rich transitions, visual filters, intros/credits, texts, sounds, and more.
