 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free...until you download their software and it tries to charge you.

Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.

But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.

## What Is an IP Camera?

When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.

Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.

However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet/meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn't need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.

## What Is Camera Software Used for?

Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.

## How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?

In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn't allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.

For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.

## If You Need to [Edit Your Videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Which Is the Best Video Editor?

Exporting or downloading content from your camera software is a messy job. You often need a good video editor and trimmer to make your video clips usable.

This is especially true when video recordings can go on for as long as 90 days at a time. If you are looking for a high-quality and flexible video editor, then [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is your only real and viable choice. Learn more from [Wondershare Video Community](https://www.wondershare.com/explore/inspiration.html).

Filmora takes users' needs into consideration and comes up with a variety of useful features to make editing easy for people of different levels. Let's have a look at the useful features of Filmora to better understand how powerful Filmora is.

* Auto Synchronization: This allows you to sync video and audio easily.
* Plenty of transitions, effects, elements make your videos more interesting.
* Audio Ducking: Automatically reduce the volume of the background music to make the dialogue stand out.
* Wondershare Drive: Upload video or project to Wondershare Drive and download it to complete anywhere you want.
* Motion Tracking: Attach an element to a moving object in your video easily with auto motion tracking.
* Keyframing: Customize animation by adding keyframes to change the position, rotation, scale, and opacity of a clip.
* Color Match: Match the color of selected clips to another frame from another clip.

## 10 Best Free Security Camera Software

Now let’s have a look at the 10 best free security camera software with very comprehensive choosing details.

#### 1. [NetCam Studio](https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/netcam-studio.jpg)

There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.

After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn't be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.

**The NetCam Studio Features**

If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.

#### 2. [Security Eye](https://www.security-eye-software.com/)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/security-eye.jpg)

The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).

**Security Eye Features**

You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.

**Pros**

It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec

The full version has no nag screen or recording limit

The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software

**Cons**

#### 3. [Perfect Surveillance](https://www.perfect-surveillance.com/)

There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.

The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices

#### 4. [iVideon](https://www.ivideon.com/)

There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.

**iVideon Features**

One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.

#### 5. [Xeoma](https://felenasoft.com/xeoma/en/)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xeoma.jpg)

This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.

**Xeoma Features**

The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.

Updates are very frequent

#### 7. [Deskshare IP Camera Viewer](https://www.deskshare.com/ip-camera-viewer.aspx)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deskshare.gif)

The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.

**Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features**

Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.

#### 8. [Anycam](https://anycam.io/)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/anycam.jpg)

The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.

**Anycam Features**

Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.

**Pros**

The program seems to work with any type of camera

Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates

Installing and setup is very easy

**Cons**

Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly

The free version only allows two cameras to be linked

#### 9. [ContaCam](https://www.contaware.com/donationware-license.html)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/contacam.jpg)

In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.

**ContaCam Features**

Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.

**Pros**

A rather advanced piece of software

The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing

You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds

**Cons**

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/agent-dvr.jpg)

The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.

**Agent DVR Features**

The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.

**Pros**

A very simple and lightweight piece of software

Works all the way back to Windows 7

It still works with motion detection systems

**Cons**

Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years

Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10

The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software

## Conclusion

As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.

Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?

Have any of these worked for you? Ask your friends on social media, start a discussion, and share this article to help others discover the best free security camera software.

The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.

**Agent DVR Features**

The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.

**Pros**

A very simple and lightweight piece of software

Works all the way back to Windows 7

It still works with motion detection systems

**Cons**

Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years

Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10

The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software

## Conclusion

As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.

Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?

Have any of these worked for you? Ask your friends on social media, start a discussion, and share this article to help others discover the best free security camera software.

Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free...until you download their software and it tries to charge you.

Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.

But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.

## What Is an IP Camera?

When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.

Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.

However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet/meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn't need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.

## What Is Camera Software Used for?

Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.

## How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?

In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn't allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.

For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.

## If You Need to [Edit Your Videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Which Is the Best Video Editor?

Exporting or downloading content from your camera software is a messy job. You often need a good video editor and trimmer to make your video clips usable.

This is especially true when video recordings can go on for as long as 90 days at a time. If you are looking for a high-quality and flexible video editor, then [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is your only real and viable choice. Learn more from [Wondershare Video Community](https://www.wondershare.com/explore/inspiration.html).

Filmora takes users' needs into consideration and comes up with a variety of useful features to make editing easy for people of different levels. Let's have a look at the useful features of Filmora to better understand how powerful Filmora is.

The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.

**Agent DVR Features**

The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.

**Pros**

A very simple and lightweight piece of software

Works all the way back to Windows 7

It still works with motion detection systems

**Cons**

Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years

Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10

The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software

## Conclusion

As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.

Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?

Have any of these worked for you? Ask your friends on social media, start a discussion, and share this article to help others discover the best free security camera software.

"I need to convert some general audio files to AIFF, do you have any recommendations?"

We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn't have any problem finding some that you can use to **AIFF converter**!

#### In this article

01 [What's So Good About AIFF?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **What's So Good About AIFF?**

### 01**What's AIFF?**

AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988\. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It's accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.

### 02**Why Is It So Popular?**

Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one's disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.

****3\. Online Converter**

The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It's more limited though — in that it doesn't support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.

****4\. [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

For this next **AIFF Converter**, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it's capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion

| Highlights                                                                                                                                                     | Highlights                                                                                                                                  |

****5\. EaseUS Video Converter**

With 'EaseUS Video Converter' we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it's closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It's a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.

| Highlights                                                                                                   | Highlights                                                                                    |

****6\. Wondershare UniConverter**

This next software, the 'Wondershare UniConverter' is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter. As is evident from the UI (shown-off in the screenshot provided), it has the makings of a straightforward converter but with extra tools (i.e., video editor, video compressor, merger, screen recorder, etc.) that you can take advantage of while working on your conversions.

| Highlights                                                                                                    | Highlights                                                                                                                         |

****7\. VSDC Free Audio Converter**

Next up, we have VSDC VSDC is a FREE Audio Converter. It's pretty old-school (as is perhaps evident from the UI example) but it supports a variety of audio formats, including AIFF, which earned it a spot on this list of ours

****9\. iTunes - Apple**

This is a hidden feature that not many people know about, but iTunes actually works as a pretty serviceable **AIFF Converter**. It's not the most efficient, but with iTunes' AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).

Last, but not least, is Convertio We circle back with this fourth and last online converter It's actually quite advanced. Although, just like many of the other FREEmium online converters we've listed, it's not 100% FREE and comes with a lot of limitations.

"I need to convert some general audio files to AIFF, do you have any recommendations?"

We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn't have any problem finding some that you can use to **AIFF converter**!

#### In this article

01 [What's So Good About AIFF?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily](#Part 2)

03 [What Makes AIFF Converter the Best Free Online Tool for Mac Users?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's So Good About AIFF?**

But okay, what's the deal with AIFF? Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we've prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you'd prefer to see the tutorial on **AIFF Converters** or our list of recommendations.

### 01**What's AIFF?**

AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988\. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It's accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.

### 02**Why Is It So Popular?**

Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one's disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.

## Part 2 **How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily**

For this next section, we'll be teaching you how to **convert M4A to AIFF** with an online **AIFF converter**.

****5\. EaseUS Video Converter**

With 'EaseUS Video Converter' we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it's closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It's a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.

****6\. Wondershare UniConverter**

This next software, the 'Wondershare UniConverter' is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter.

****9\. iTunes - Apple**

This is a hidden feature that not many people know about, but iTunes actually works as a pretty serviceable **AIFF Converter**. It's not the most efficient, but with iTunes' AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).

"I need to convert some general audio files to AIFF, do you have any recommendations?"

We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn't have any problem finding some that you can use to **AIFF converter**!

#### In this article

01 [What's So Good About AIFF?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily](#Part 2)

03 [What Makes AIFF Converter the Best Free Online Tool for Mac Users?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's So Good About AIFF?**

But okay, what's the deal with AIFF? Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we've prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you'd prefer to see the tutorial on **AIFF Converters** or our list of recommendations.

### 01**What's AIFF?**

AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988\. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It's accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.

### 02**Why Is It So Popular?**

Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one's disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.

## Part 2 **How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily**

For this next section, we'll be teaching you how to **convert M4A to AIFF** with an online **AIFF converter**.

"I need to convert some general audio files to AIFF, do you have any recommendations?"

We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn't have any problem finding some that you can use to **AIFF converter**!

#### In this article

01 [What's So Good About AIFF?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily](#Part 2)

03 [What Makes AIFF Converter the Best Free Online Tool for Mac Users?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's So Good About AIFF?**

But okay, what's the deal with AIFF? Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we've prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you'd prefer to see the tutorial on **AIFF Converters** or our list of recommendations.

### 01**What's AIFF?**

AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988\. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It's accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.

### 02**Why Is It So Popular?**

Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one's disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.

## Part 2 **How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily**

For this next section, we'll be teaching you how to **convert M4A to AIFF** with an online **AIFF converter**. The benefit of using an online converter like the one we'll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient.

****2\. ConvertOnMac**

Our next recommended tool is Convert on Mac This is another online tool that can be used to convert a variety of files (i.e., audio, video, image, document, etc). The one that we'll be focusing on though is Convert on Mac's **AIFF Converter**

| Highlights                                                                                                                                                          | Highlights                                                                                                              |

****3\. Online Converter**

The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It's more limited though — in that it doesn't support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.

****4\. [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

****5\. EaseUS Video Converter**

With 'EaseUS Video Converter' we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it's closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It's a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.

****6\. Wondershare UniConverter**

This next software, the 'Wondershare UniConverter' is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter. As is evident from the UI (shown-off in the screenshot provided), it has the makings of a straightforward converter but with extra tools (i.e., video editor, video compressor, merger, screen recorder, etc.) that you can take advantage of while working on your conversions.
