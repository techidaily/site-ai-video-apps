VirtualDub is a free and powerful video capture and processing software for Windows platform. Other than being able to accomplish the basic video editing tasks such as compress, trim, remove audio, you can also apply special effects like adding subtitles and more. However, if you have transferred to the Mac platform, you may need a VirtualDub alternative for Mac because VirtualDub only supports Windows OS natively.
