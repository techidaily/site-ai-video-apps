 **Intro/credit:**  just like you see in movie theaters and on DVDs, you may want to add an intro at the beginning of your movie that tells people a little bit about your movie and add credits at the end to tell the world who created and starred in it.

Filmora for Mac allows you to caption with more than **200 titles and text styles** with or without animation. To do this, just switch to the Intro/Credit tab and drag the effects to the place where you want it to appear. Then double click and go to “Title” to enter your words or change the Font, Size, and Color of the texts.
