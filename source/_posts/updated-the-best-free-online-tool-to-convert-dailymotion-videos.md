A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.

After all, materials are ready, and you need to make animation alive. In this step, you need to make sure all the movements are natural. Stiff moves are not liked by the audience, so you need to think about how to design gestures, movements, and facial expressions.
