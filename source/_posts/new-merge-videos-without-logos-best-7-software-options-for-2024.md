The majority of individuals favor OIS over EIS. A hardware approach is always preferable to a software platform since EIS is essentially a repair solution that causes picture resolution deterioration by cutting it and estimating what this would seem like if it were steady. OIS also performs better in low-light conditions. The best video stabilizer app for android is the one that incorporates both approaches.

Moreover, OIS and EIS both hold a significant reputation for video stabilization. And not much, but some people prefer Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) to stabilize their video as it converts the optical signal to a digital one. You will get a better understanding of both the stabilization technologies after reading what's written below:

**Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)**

Electronic image stabilization operates on a fundamentally different premise, with the problem being tackled at the coding layer after the visible light has been transformed to a digital signal.

**Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)**

The picture is stabilized with this approach by altering the optical path of the detector. Because this is real-time correction, no image change or degradation occurs. The lens component is rotated such that it is parallel to the picture plane.
