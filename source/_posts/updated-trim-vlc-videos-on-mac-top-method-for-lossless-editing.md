_Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?_ Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.

In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.

* [Section 1\. Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality](#why-trim-vlc-loss-quality)
* [Section 2\. Video editor to trim VLC videos without loss of quality](#software-trim-vlc-without-loss-quality)

## Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?

To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!

#### 1\. Codec

Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.

#### 2\. Container

A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.

Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.

#### 3\. Video compression and re-encoding

You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.

When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. **Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.**

The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.

When you make changes to a video with a **video trimmer app**, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.

## Section 2.  The software you can use to trim VLC videos without loss of quality

Fortunately, there are plenty of video editing programs available online that you can use to trim videos without losing quality. Here are three of the best video cutters:

1. [Wondershare Filmora](#way1)
2. [LosslessCut](#way2)
3. [TunesKit Video Cutter](#way3)

**All three of these video trimmers can be downloaded for free.**

### 1. Trimming VLC with [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is a powerful [video editor for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Windows. It is a good choice to trim VLC video. You can cut and combine videos without losing the quality. Filmora supports pretty much every video format there is, so you don't have to worry about codecs and containers.

If you’re working with a long video, you can take advantage of Filmora unique feature called “Scene Detection.” With this feature, the software will automatically detect scene changes in the VLC video and separate them, making it easy for you to trim it into multiple clips. If you want to trim your video manually, you can just drag the trimming sliders according to how you want to cut the video.

#### More features of Filmora

* **Effect Plugins:** Cooperate with New Blue & Boris, Filmora allows you to access and use all the fantastic effects from these two outstanding effects producers.
* **Stock Media:** No need to open Chrome or other browser to search for royalty-free images/footages/gifs any more. You can find Giphy, Pixbay, Unsplash within Filmora.
* **Speed Ramping**: Feel free to speed up or slow down a certain video clip.
* **Green Screen:** Get more creative by using Green Screen to create your video.

* Pros: With Filmora, you can easily edit VLC video lossless, it is free to download.
* Cons: If you are not a member, the output video may have a watermark.

### 2. Trimming VLC through LosslessCut

LosslessCut is an open-source video cutter that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. Like Filmora, this software also allows you to cut videos without re-encoding, so there is no loss of quality. It is user-friendlier than Filmora – all you have to do is drag your video to the software and then you can start trimming it by using the Arrow symbols.

![lossescut for trimming VLC video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/lossescut.jpg)

One unique feature of LosslessCut is that it lets you take JPEG screenshots of the video. It also has a portable version that doesn’t require any installation and can be started directly from a USB.

* Pros: LosslessCut works best with mobile videos or action cams like GoPro.
* Cons: It supports a whole range of video formats, but don’t expect to edit 4K videos using this software. It’s simple and easy to use for a reason.

### 3. Trimming VLC via [TunesKit Video Converter](https://www.tuneskit.com/video-cutter-for-win.html)

TunesKit is a simple video trimmer software that’s available on both Mac and Windows. Unlike Filmora and LosslessCut, TunesKit supports a very limited number of video formats. It is mainly an MP4 video cutter. It works at a much faster speed and there is no loss of quality.

![tuneskit to trim vlc video without lossing quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/tuneskit.jpg)

* Pros: The interface, while simpler than Filmora’s, can seem a bit confusing sometimes. TunesKit also has a video editor, which lets you add effects to different segments of the trimmed video, a feature that you probably won’t be using very often. To trim VLC videos in MP4 without re-encoding, you simply have to drag the slider that appears when you import your video.
* Cons: However, its functions may not be as rich as Filmora.

#### Conclusion

If you trim your VLC video, it will result in data loss, which will lead to a reduction in quality. Losing quality is inevitable with most video editors, which is why you should [Download Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as it's easy to use and has the best and most useful features.

Filmora supports many popular formats like MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and also different screen resolutions so no matter what the format of your VLC video is, you can easily divide it by scenes using the Scene Detection feature and quickly turn those scenes into clips.

It is user-friendlier than Filmora – all you have to do is drag your video to the software and then you can start trimming it by using the Arrow symbols.

![lossescut for trimming VLC video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/lossescut.jpg)

One unique feature of LosslessCut is that it lets you take JPEG screenshots of the video. It also has a portable version that doesn’t require any installation and can be started directly from a USB.

* Pros: LosslessCut works best with mobile videos or action cams like GoPro.
* Cons: It supports a whole range of video formats, but don’t expect to edit 4K videos using this software. It’s simple and easy to use for a reason.

### 3. Trimming VLC via [TunesKit Video Converter](https://www.tuneskit.com/video-cutter-for-win.html)

TunesKit is a simple video trimmer software that’s available on both Mac and Windows. Unlike Filmora and LosslessCut, TunesKit supports a very limited number of video formats. It is mainly an MP4 video cutter. It works at a much faster speed and there is no loss of quality.

![tuneskit to trim vlc video without lossing quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/tuneskit.jpg)

* Pros: The interface, while simpler than Filmora’s, can seem a bit confusing sometimes. TunesKit also has a video editor, which lets you add effects to different segments of the trimmed video, a feature that you probably won’t be using very often. To trim VLC videos in MP4 without re-encoding, you simply have to drag the slider that appears when you import your video.
* Cons: However, its functions may not be as rich as Filmora.

#### Conclusion

If you trim your VLC video, it will result in data loss, which will lead to a reduction in quality. Losing quality is inevitable with most video editors, which is why you should [Download Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as it's easy to use and has the best and most useful features.

Filmora supports many popular formats like MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and also different screen resolutions so no matter what the format of your VLC video is, you can easily divide it by scenes using the Scene Detection feature and quickly turn those scenes into clips.

Metadata is the pieces of information that help viewers understand what a video is about without having to watch it from start to finish. Things like titles, keywords, tags, timestamps, and descriptions are some metadata that should be added to a video before it is published online.

Adding the right metadata to your video is useful for many reasons. It makes it easy for search engines to correctly identify and index your video. This in turn helps viewers find your video when they search Google, iTunes, or video sharing platforms like YouTube and Vimeo.

For more experienced videographers, metadata is useful at every stage of the process of making a video, from production to post-production and publishing. Without the right metadata, professional video production and editing would be a very uphill task.

The best multimedia editors have metadata editing features. It’s also good to have a lightweight, standalone application to edit and customize video metadata quickly. In this post, we share the 8 best video metadata editors for macOS users.

## 8 Best Video Metadata Editors for Mac

It can be purchased for roughly $60 though a trial version is available for free.

**FEATURES:** This software makes video editing easy with lots of extras like built-in audio tracks, sound effects, title presets, transition effects, and more. FilmoraPro lets users add metadata during the export process. Simply click the export button, which is now at the top of the media window.

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - Mojo Stories Editor ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mojo-stories-editor.jpg)

### 4\. [Over: Design/Flyers/Story Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/over-design-flyer-story-maker/id535811906)

### 6\. [Steller](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steller/id785128002)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - Steller Discover·Create·Share Stories](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/steller-app-for-creating-share-stories.jpg)

It has already been five years since Steller was named as one of the best apps on the App Store by Apple, but very little has changed in the meantime. You don’t have to be a professional storyteller in order to create engaging visual stories with this app since you can select a theme you like and let Steller do all the heavy lifting for you. There just ten text styles to choose from and the app doesn’t offer even the basic video editing tools, which limits your options throughout the video editing process. Nonetheless, you can share all video content you edit with Steller directly to your Instagram Stories.

### 7\. [Unfold](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unfold-create-stories/id1247275033)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** Requires iOS 10.0 or later

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - Unfold  Story Editor & Collage Maker  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unfold-create-stories.jpg)

Creating Facebook or Instagram Stories that attract the attention of thousands of daily viewers is what Unfold does best. You can apply ten different filters and effects to all videos you record with this app and then choose from over 150 video templates. Unfold also grants you access to advanced text tools that enable you to customize the messages you want to distribute through social media channels. The free version of Unfold offers only a limited range of options, and you must upgrade to Unfold+ if you want to access all of the themes, fonts, and stickers this app provides. Despite the great user rating, Unfold still lacks video and audio editing tools that would allow its users to manipulate their footage without any restrictions.

### 8\. [24 FPS – Video Filter & LUT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/24fps-video-filter-lut/id1341136787)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** Requires iOS 12.0 or later

iPhone owners in need of a video editing app that allows them to record and edit their footage with professional tools should consider installing 24 FPS. In addition to excellent video recording capabilities, this app features a plethora of options you can use to enhance the colors in the videos you edit. Importing LUTs into 24 FPS is a routine operation that can reduce the amount of time you have to spend on giving a video a particular cinematic style. Skin-thinning and skin smoothing filters enable you to beautify the people in your videos and make them more visually appealing to the online audience. The app’s video editor also contains audio editing options that make creating a video’s soundtrack fun and enjoyable.

### 9\. [VUE – Video Camera and Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vue-video-camera-and-editor/id1458609369)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

Besides offering more than twenty filters, Vue also lets you change a video’s playback speed, merge or split multiple clips and enhance the colors of each clip you edit. The seemingly endless library of royalty-free songs offers you all the resources you are going to need while creating a soundtrack for your video, and you can also control the volume of video’s original sound and audio files you added to a project.

### 10 [1 Second Every Day: Video Diary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1-second-everyday-video-diary/id587823548)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** Requires iOS11.2

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - Steller Discover·Create·Share Stories](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/steller-app-for-creating-share-stories.jpg)

It has already been five years since Steller was named as one of the best apps on the App Store by Apple, but very little has changed in the meantime.

The free version of Unfold offers only a limited range of options, and you must upgrade to Unfold+ if you want to access all of the themes, fonts, and stickers this app provides. Despite the great user rating, Unfold still lacks video and audio editing tools that would allow its users to manipulate their footage without any restrictions.

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

Skin-thinning and skin smoothing filters enable you to beautify the people in your videos and make them more visually appealing to the online audience. The app’s video editor also contains audio editing options that make creating a video’s soundtrack fun and enjoyable.

The seemingly endless library of royalty-free songs offers you all the resources you are going to need while creating a soundtrack for your video, and you can also control the volume of video’s original sound and audio files you added to a project.

### 10 [1 Second Every Day: Video Diary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1-second-everyday-video-diary/id587823548)

Besides offering more than twenty filters, Vue also lets you change a video’s playback speed, merge or split multiple clips and enhance the colors of each clip you edit. The seemingly endless library of royalty-free songs offers you all the resources you are going to need while creating a soundtrack for your video, and you can also control the volume of video’s original sound and audio files you added to a project.

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - 1 Second Everyday: Video Diary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-second-everyday-video-diary.jpg)

Simple, routine activities like capturing a single moment every day can help you create a collection of all the exciting things you do on a daily basis. 1 Second Every Day app is designed to help you create a video diary that sums up the most important moments of your day. You can either create Freestyle videos you take at different types of events and your journeys or capture standard Timeline videos that have the form of a classic video diary. The app can also auto-fill your timeline if you are struggling to find a good idea for your daily diary entry, and it supports unlimited mashing so that you can combine videos over a five-year or one-month period without any video length restrictions.

**Conclusion**

According to Apple, some of the most popular apps for the iPhone are built for storytellers, and this trend is going to continue in 2024 as the demand for video content can only increase. Consequently, some of the best iOS apps can be found in the Photo & Video category as they provide the tools that simplify the process of creating social media videos. Which app are you using to create your stories? Leave a comment and let us know.
