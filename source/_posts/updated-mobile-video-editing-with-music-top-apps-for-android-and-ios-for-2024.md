Video editing used to be a long and complicated process, but today **recording and editing a short video** with your Smartphone is as easy as taking a selfie. A growing number of apps also offer royalty free music so their users can create perfect lip-sync videos. These apps enable you to **be a part of a community of short music video creators** and to produce entertaining videos in which you dance and sing to your favorite songs.

If you want to become a part of this thriving community, but don't know which app to use, you've come to the right place, because in this article we are going to introduce you to some of the best apps for making music videos on iOS and Android smartphones.

#### 1. TikTok (including Musical.ly)

A short while ago TikTok and Musical.ly merged into a single app that lets you create lip-sync videos effortlessly. The app grants you access to a sizeable music library where you can find music from Pop, Rock or R&B genres, so you just have to browse through it and select the song you like and hit the Record button afterward. The TikTok's video editing features include easy-to-use cut and trim tools, duplicate video and merge options that allow you to have complete creative control over the footage you record.

In addition, you can add visual effects and stickers to your videos and if you decide to go live you'll be able to use some of the live streaming filters.

The only downside is that music videos you record with Triller can't last longer than 30 seconds.

The app's music collection includes some of the most popular songs at the moment, so you can even participate in different music challenges or create lip-sync videos with music from your favorite singers.
