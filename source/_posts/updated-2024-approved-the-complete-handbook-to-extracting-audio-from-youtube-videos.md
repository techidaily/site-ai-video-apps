If you are looking for a media player that can open both Blu-ray and DVD discs, you should look no further, because Leawo Blu-ray player is equipped with a plethora of features that make every home theater experience more enjoyable. The player lets you open DVD files, DVD folders, as well as DVD ISO and IFO files, however, you cannot use it to play videos in resolutions larger than 1080p.

Leawo Blu-ray player enables you to watch or listen to the content from Blu-ray discs on Windows 10 and all other versions of the OS up to Windows Vista. Adding subtitles or selecting the audio track of a video file is easy and optionally you can search through the DVD player’s subtitle library if the original video doesn’t have built-in subtitles. More advanced video playback options like screencasting or screen capturing are not available, which means that you can only watch the videos that are stored on DVDs or Blu-rays from your computer.

**Pros**

* Allows users to load multiple files simultaneously
* Compatible with all versions of Windows OS since Windows Vista
* Intuitive media control menu
* Excellent audio decoding options

**Cons**

* No advanced video and audio playback options

### 10\. Macgo Windows Blu-ray

Even though this media player is primarily designed for macOS, the manufacturer announced that the Windows version of the app is going to become available soon. The Macgo Windows Blu-ray player is expected to offer support for a broad range of Blu-ray file formats and video files, which should enable its users to watch or listen to content without any restrictions. The media player can also display a variety of photo file formats, including CR2 files, and its users can utilize it to browse through their photo collections and ever view RAW files.

The current Mac-based versions of the software offer support for Dolby TrueHD Audio DTS-HD Master Audio and DTS 5.1 codecs that ensure you can hear every sound in a video accurately. Macgo Windows Blu-ray should also be equipped with a range of subtitle options that allow you to customize the color, size or the font of a video’s subtitles.

**Pros**

* Supports nearly all Blu-ray and video file formats
* Powerful audio playback features
* Displays image files
* Offers online video playback options

**Cons**

* This Blu-ray and DVD player is still in Beta stage

**Conclusion**

Even though Windows 10 doesn’t have a native DVD or Blu-ray players, finding a media player that enables you to watch video and audio content from Blu-ray or DVD discs shouldn’t be too difficult. Media players like Pot Player or VLC are powerful enough to provide smooth playback of all audio and video files for free, while DVD players like PowerDVD or KMPlayer are a better option if you are looking for a true home theater experience.
