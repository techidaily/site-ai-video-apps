The amount of video content uploaded to the Internet each day is staggering, as people around the globe create hundreds of hours of videos daily. As a result, the videos you upload to social media must stand out in this sea of content to get thousands of views, shares, or likes.

**[Speeding up or slowing down the footage](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is a simple and yet effective video editing technique that can make the content you share online more entertaining to watch. Read on if you would like to find out more about **slow and fast motion video apps for iOS and Android** devices you can use to process your footage before posting it on your social media accounts.

## 10 Best Video Speed Changing Apps for iOS and Android

Sharing the raw footage, you capture on a Smartphone with your friends and followers may not always produce the results you’re hoping for. Slowing down the playback speed can make a scene more entertaining or highlight an important moment in your video. Increasing a video’s playback speed is a great option if you want to create breathtaking time-lapses. So, let’s take a look at the **10 best video speed-changing apps for slow and fast motion video editing on iOS and Android devices.**

### 1\. Filmora for mobile

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** [iOS](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) 11.0 or later, [Android](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) 4.2 and up

Changing the playback speed of the footage you edit with Filmora takes just a few moments since this cross-platform app enables all of its users to choose how rapidly the frames in each shot will be displayed on the screen.

This app provides a versatile set of video editing tools, enabling you to **enhance the colors in your videos**, make a soundtrack or even **[create a PIP effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. The only downside is that the free version of the app watermarks all videos you export from it, and you must make an in-app purchase in order to remove the watermark from your videos.

* A rich library of visual effects
* Supports all common video file formats
* Versatile color correction tools

**Cons**

* All videos created with the free version of Filmora are watermarked

As soon as you record a new video clip with your iPhone or Android phone, you can import it into the app and remove all parts you don’t want to include in the final cut.

Altering the speed of a video clip is easy since you have to decide if you want to speed up or slow down a video and then insert a new playback speed value.

The app offers 26 fully customizable themes, and it enables its users to [combine photos and videos.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Creating a slow-motion or fast-forward video with Quik is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few taps.

With this app, you don’t need any video editing experience to create slow or fast motion videos. Import the footage you recorded with your Android phone and choose one of the preset video playback options. The app lets you increase or decrease a video clip’s speed up to four times, so you have to select the portion of a video you’d like to speed up or slow down and export it to your phone’s gallery.

Optionally, you can [add music to each video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you edit with this app, but you won’t be able to perform color corrections or apply visual effects to the footage you process with this app.

![videoshop video editor for changing video speed ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoshop-interface.jpg)

Performing all basic video editing tasks, like [cutting or merging video clips,](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)doesn’t require advanced video editing skills.

Increasing or decreasing a video’s playback speed takes only a few minutes, enabling you to post fast or slow-motion videos on your social media accounts just a few moments after you recorded them.

![slow fast slow - control the speed  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slow-fast-slow-control-the-speed-of-your-videos.jpg)

iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch owners can use this app to control the playback speed of all videos they record with their devices. The app’s timeline is designed to help you set points at specific segments of the video, enabling you to speed up or slow down only a portion of the video clip without cutting it.

KineMaster is one of the[best video editing apps for iOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Android devices you can find on the market. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the app offers powerful tools that enable its users to create slow-motion videos and time-lapses.

In addition, KineMaster is equipped with EQ presets and audio editing tools you’re going to need to fix the original audio of the video clips you speed up or slow down.

![speedpro slow speed video edit ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/speedpro-slow-speed-video-edit.jpg)

Changing a video clip’s playback speed with this app is a simple three-step process. After you import a video clip into the app, you will be taken to the Adjust Speed screen, where you can choose if you want to alter the playback speed of an entire video clip or speed up or slow down a particular segment of a video.

Afterward, you have to drag the Video Speed slider to the left or to the right and the app will automatically adjust the speed of your video. When done, you can import an audio file from your phone and proceed to export the file to the camera roll or upload it to YouTube or Instagram.

**Pros**

* Effortless file importing process
* Changing a video’s playback speed requires you to drag a slider

**Supported OS:** iOS 13.0 or later

You can [change a video’s playback speed in iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) even if you have never edited a video before. After you create a new project and import a video clip into the app, you have to tap on the Speed icon. A slider that enables you to reduce a video’s playback speed to 1/8 of its original speed or make it twice as fast will appear on the screen, so you can drag it left or right to set a new playback speed for your video.

If you are not happy with the results, you can tap on the Reset button, and iMovie will return the playback speed of your video clip to its normal value.

**Pros**

* Free and easy playback speed adjustment process
