Fortunately, there are more than a few simple ways to combine and merge multiple clips, that don’t involve using professional video editing apps. So even if you are a newcomer to the world of video content production you won’t have any trouble creating social media videos. That’s why in this article we are going to present to you some of the best online platforms that enable you to merge your video clips effortlessly.

![add-fire-effect-to-the-hand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/video-effect/add-fire-effect-to-the-hand.jpg)

## The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022

The maximum file size a platform lets you upload or the number of supported file formats are among the most important factors you will have to consider before you choose an online video merger. In addition, the platform’s processing ability as well as the export options can have a significant impact on the quality of the video you’ll be able to produce. Here are the five best online video mergers you can use to create your social media videos in 2022.

#### 1. [Merge Video](https://mergevideo.online/)

This video editing platform allows you to do much more than just arrange and merge video clips, because it offers tools that enable you to resize, crop or rotate videos, adjust the colors in the footage you upload to the platform or cut and merge audio files. The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.

#### 3. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/)

Even though this website is mostly dedicated to the conversion of different types of files, you can also use it to merge, cut, crop or rotate video files. Aconvert supports nearly all commonly used video file formats, so you can upload and merge mp4, flv, mov or avi files among numerous others. The maximum size of a video clip you can upload to this platform can’t exceed 1GB and you need to make sure that all files you want to merge have the same frame rate and format. Once you click the Submit button, you won’t be able to rearrange your video files, which is why you have to upload video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output video. After the merging process is completed, you will be able to save the result on Dropbox, Google Drive or your Smartphone via a QR code.

#### 4. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/maker/editor)

![kapwing_1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/video-effect/kapwing_1.jpg)

The wide range of video editing tools that the Kapwing offers makes it one of the best online video editors. You can use Kapwing to make video montages, crop videos, rotate them or perform any other basic video editing action without even having an account on the platform. In order to start merging the video clips you just have to select the Video Maker option, upload video files from an online source or from your computer and arrange them in any way you want. The platform also lets you choose the aspect ratio of the output video which enables you to create vertical or square videos effortlessly. Simply click on the Create! button when you are ready to export the video, and wait for the new file to be generated. Afterward, you can proceed to download the video to your computer or save it to your iPhone, but keep in mind that all videos you create with the free version of Kapwing are going to be watermarked.

#### 5. [Cellsea](http://www.cellsea.com/free-online-video-editor)

Cellsea is a platform where you can create your own ringtones, edit photos or merge videos for free. Its video editing tools enable you to cut, trim or resize videos, which makes it quite useful in case you want to polish your video before sharing it on social media. To start merging several video clips you just have to upload those files to Cellsea, but unfortunately, you can only upload files that are stored on your computer. When done, you can choose the output format of the video file and save it as mov, mp4, flv 3gp or avi file.

## The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022

The maximum file size a platform lets you upload or the number of supported file formats are among the most important factors you will have to consider before you choose an online video merger.

The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.

#### 3. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/)

## Part 4: 4 Tips on Making Animated Logo

### 1\. Make a short and beautiful animated logo

You don't want people to watch a long animated logo video as viewers need to wait for a long time to know your real meaning. You just need to make an animated logo as short as possible. However, shortness doesn't mean it is plain. You can still express brand and product meaning very well with beautiful design and reasonable logo shape. To do that, you need to understand the meaning behind your logo.

### 3\. Branding your company

Whatever you do, [you should keep in mind that branding comes first](https://uxplanet.org/dont-stay-still-why-brand-needs-an-animated-logo-91cf3c7f69b7?gi=1cace4ea840d). An excellent animated logo can add a powerful branding impact to your company. In return, more and more people will come to your company and like it. It is a virtuous circle. If you still don't know the importance of the brand, now it is time to animate the logo!

### 4\. Make a good impression

A good impression means your animated logo quite fits the company style or the industry style, so you need to know what part of your company can arouse the user's feelings.

## Part 5: FAQ about Animated Logo Makers

### 1\. Which software is best for logo animation?

Logo animation software is not short on the ground. Most regular editing programs will have features that let you add an animation to your logo. We would recommend that you look at After Effects, by Adobe, since it contains numerous features specifically dealing with animation. You may even be able to use the free version of this software without paying for the whole program.

Logo animation software in aftereffects usually needs to be applied to existing footage. Otherwise, you can find it available for download by following this link.

### 2\. How do I make an animated logo?

When you are using Filmora Pro as your logo animation software, there are steps you need to take to achieve full animation. First, prepare your file by opening a new workspace with a web resolution of about 320 x 240\. Select your background layer, then add in any graphics or art you have for your logo. Choose the effect you want to apply and drag and drop it, then adjust the settings in the box that pops up.

You can assign keyframes for specific actions or play with the settings to achieve the animation you had in mind.

### 3\. How do I make an animated logo for free?

PixTeller is such an excellent service because it has logo animation software that is free to use. It allows you to work with all types of formats. So if you have a logo as a JPEG, or whether you want to draw it out in vector graphics, you can do so.

## Final Verdict

We would here like to state that you can use Wondershare Filmora if you want to make a breathtaking intro video. This software is the best choice for its 2D and 3D intro logo effects package. Also, we hope that by now, you have decided which to use and started working on your logo intros. You can share with us if we missed any other logo animation maker and if you like this post. Thanks!
