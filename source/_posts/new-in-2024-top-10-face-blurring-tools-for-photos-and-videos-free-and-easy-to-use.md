Even though iMovie offers a rich selection of video editing options, unfortunately, there are no options that enable you to blur or pixelate a face. To conceal a beginning or an object in a video, you'll have toadd a non-transparent layer over the area of the video you'd like to hide. This is by no means an elegant solution since adding a monochrome rectangle over a video can completely ruin its visual appeal. Using iMovie to conceal faces in videos is only a good option if, for whatever reason, you can't install any other app that grants you more control over the process of blurring faces in videos.
