## Conclusion

Text animation is a great way to present your video. It is true that you can make animation on your phone, but editing on desktop is necessary if you want to have more controls on animation video. Here we recommend using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can use it to make 3D animation text by adding keyframes, so the animated text will be smooth and natural. You just need to build a white plane to easily start making animation. When exporting, you can also export transparent animation text. Download it to have a try (Free)!
