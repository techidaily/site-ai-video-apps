And then move the top of the red Time Indicator to put it at one point you want, click the scissor-like icon, move the Time Indicator to another point, and hit the scissor icon again. In this way, you can split the 3GP file into several clips.

If you want to chop a big 3GP file into several small-size files, at this time, you need to save the whole project for backup purpose. Then, import the saved project again and again to delete redundant clips to just export the only one into a single file each time.

But if you want to cut out some unwanted segments or to extract some parts you want, just hit the clips you don’t want and click the “Delete” icon.

#### 3 Export the rest 3GP clips

When everything is done, just press the “Create” button to export the new file. At this time, a pop-up window will pop up to let you select an output method. If you still want to keep the file in 3GP format, just go to Format category and choose 3GP as the output format. After that, you can find the output file according to the output path.
Wondershare 3GP Cutter and splitter also lets you to directly upload to any of those popular video sharing sites such as Youtube, Facebook, Vimeo etc. or to export to any popular mobile devices.

#### 3.) Moo0 Video Cutter

Another very easy to use program which supports 3GP. It creates a copy of the section you want to cut and retained, leaving you worry free to do what you wish with the original file. Video formats supported are less than Free Video Cutter. Be sure to check if your original file is supported if you are cutting video clips other than 3GP.
