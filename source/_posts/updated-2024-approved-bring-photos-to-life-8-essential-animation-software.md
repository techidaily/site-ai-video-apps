Days are gone when vertical video were said to be shameful content. These days vertical videos are widely used and they also have a market on social media. But before you are creating these videos vertically, you need to be very careful about the things. Here are some tips that can make your vertical videos even better:

**Aspect ratios:** The **Aspect ratio for social media**plays a major role in the success of the videos. This is the reason why aspect ratios are must to understand. As far as vertical videos are concerned it can be said that the aspect ratio can be anything just greater than 1:The most recommended aspect ratio for vertical video is 9:16 as it covers the whole screen and also it is more immersive.

**Stay closer to the subjects:** When you are shooting your videos in a vertical frame then it can make easier for you to stay closer to your subjects. As people will be scrolling through the application then your video will be at the center. Sometimes, these videos are cut awkwardly. If you shoot the video properly then you can keep yourself away from such issues.

**Grab the attention:** users on social media spend no time to switch to another content or other version of the particular content. This is why it becomes so important to catch the attention of your viewers immediately. Try to keep the first couple of moments exceptionally engaging. This will boost the attention of the audience and also make them stay on your video.

**Rule of third can benefit you:** If you are wishing to follow this rule then it is important to know the reason behind this rule. This rule means that you should not keep the subject or object directly in front of the frame. This can look ugly and will not suit every time. Instead of this, you can make the use of imaginary vertical and horizontal lines to create better and interesting composition. This will make you frame divided into thirds. Your subject can be placed on these lines or in between the lines where they are meeting. You can get the feature of using the grid as a guide in most of the cameras and phones.
