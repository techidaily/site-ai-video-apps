This video editing software will cost you $300 to buy, and as mentioned above it will require you to have a Mac OS, so if you don't have both or if you are a[beginner in video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) we are suggesting a few alternatives for you that you might choose one from to start your video editing journey.

It supports different video formats such as MP44, MPG, AVI, OGM, MKV, FLV, and more. Here is also a [getting-started tutorial for Avidemux](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can refer to.

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/avidemux.jpg)

**Pros as an alternative to FCPX for Windows:**

### 3. [VirtualDub](http://www.virtualdub.org/)

VirtualDub is a strong video editing tool on Windows with many useful features that can help you make different kinds of changes to the video but keeping the video’s quality the same as before. It also has batch-processing capabilities for processing large numbers of files and can be extended with third-party video filters.

**Pros:**

* Can be extended with third-party video filters;
* Has batch-processing capabilities for processing large numbers of files.

**Cons:**

Outdated UI design.

### 4. [Video Toolbox](https://www.videotoolbox.com/)

Video Toolbox is a[free online video editing tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)that has a rich set of video functions. But like many online apps, it imposes a size restriction of 300 MB for your video files. To use it, you have to register first and upload the target files either from the hard disk or online video sites. Then fish the merging task use the command from a drop-down.

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-toolbox.jpg)

**Pros:**

### 6. [Movica](https://sourceforge.net/projects/movica/)

This software is, in essence, a user interface for other open-source tools that are somewhat user-unfriendly, enabling an understandable user interface for the best free tools out there. As a software package though, there is nothing wrong with this approach, and the tools available for joining and merging are first-rate, and the software works very fast, whilst offering a wide range of compatible video formats.

The interface is a little clunky, but it does the job and the software has additional tools for other editing work such as cutting and trimming as well, the added functionality in combination with a more basic interface can make some operations a touch confusing though.

![Movica](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/movica.jpg)

Ultimately a little more complicated to use, but very good.
