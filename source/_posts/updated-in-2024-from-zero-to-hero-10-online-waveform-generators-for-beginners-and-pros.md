The effects in this package need to be seen to be believed. Stunning effects, tools that make unwanted elements in the frame disappear, keyers, masks, and more eye-candy than a carnival.

## Conclusion

There are so many other firms that could be mentioned. It almost seems a shame to stop at ten. But all of these companies make excellent products that can give your projects a unique look. Also, most of them provide free trials, so you can experiment with them on your own and see which ones you can't live without.

If you want to know how to make your video powerful without using plug-ins, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the one you should use on Mac. You can use it to make effects in over 50 settings. If titles are important to you, Filmora's video editor also has various title templates free to use. Also, you can customize titles. Besides, audio is the best part you should try when editing. After trying, you will no longer need Final Cut Pro X. Now, download it to have a try (FREE).

In this article, we are going to show you how you can easily increase the speed of your video from 2X up to 20X with Final Cut Pro. Also, you can choose manual custom speed as you like.

## How to Make a Time-Lapse Video in Final Cut Pro

#### Step 1 Import Clips

Choose **File** \> **New** \> **Event**. Name it and click **OK**. Label the project **Timelapse**. Then go to **File** \> **Import Media**. Browse to source clips folder. Click **Import Selected**. Drop the clips onto the timeline.

#### Step 2 Apply Time-lapse Effect

Click the **Retime** pop-up menu below the viewer and choose **Fast** (or you can access **Modify** \> **Retime** \> **Fast**). There are 4 preset options you can choose: 2x, 4x, 8x, 20x. Or you can customize the speed by selecting **Custom**.

![ Apply Timelapse effect -1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/timelapse-in-fcp-1.png)

You can set any speed by adjusting the **Rate**. Reset the speed by clicking on the little arrow on the right side of the window.

![ Apply Timelapse effect -2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/timelapse-in-fcp-3.png)

You can also drag the retiming handle to adjust the speed: dragging to the left increases the speed, and dragging to the right decreases it.

**Note:** To set speed separately for different parts of one clip, you can choose **Blade Speed** first, and then blade the clip where you want to set different speeds.

![ Apply Timelapse effect -3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/timelapse-in-fcp-4.png)
