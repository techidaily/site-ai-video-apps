 You can now easily capture screenshots on your PS4 with the inclusion of the new _SHARE_ button on the DualShock 4 controller. This can be done either through the short or long press settings configured for your _SHARE_ button.

## Capture screenshots on PS4 with SHARE button

 You can’t miss the _SHARE_ button on the new controller for the latest PS4\. It’s sitting on the left-hand side of the touch pad (as shown in the screenshot below). A short press on _SHARE_ button (by default) will take you into the Share’s interface. In order to capture a screen shot, you’ll need to perform a long press. Alternatively, change your _Share Settings_ to _Easy Screenshots_ where the press works in contrary of the defaulted settings.

So what would you do then? Have no direction to edit video on Mac OS X 10.10?

Don’t worry. Here a comprehensive and easy-to-use video editor for Yosemite – Wondershare [Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is recommended.

### Step 2. Edit videos, audio and photos
