Another notable one, besides the app ‘Transcribe’ that we introduced earlier, is the iOS app called ‘Voice to Text Pro - Transcribe.’ This particular app offers advanced **speech-to-text** functionalities that will allow you to either transcribe live audio or upload an MP3 to transcribe. It also has support for over 150+ languages and has a convenient notes function for taking advantage of the transcription function.

### 04Google Docs

Another 100% FREE method of getting live **speech** **to text** is Google Doc’s “Voice Typing” function. You can turn this on at any time by making use of the command ‘Ctrl+Shift+S’ or by turning it on manually from the ‘Tools’ tab on a Google Document (shown in the image below). It’s a very easy way of getting your thoughts onto paper while working on other things.

Think about the type of content you're working with. Are you creating short-form clips for social media or longer, more complex videos? Different enhancers may better suit different content types, so consider your file type and potential quality issues.

### 2.Consider The Features You Need

Consider the tools and features you need from your video quality enhancer software. Each system offers different capabilities, so planning can help you find the option that best fits your requirements.

### 3.Sharing Formats and Requirements

Determine the purpose of your video project and any specific sharing requirements. Understanding your goals will help you plan accordingly, whether for online sharing or commercial use.

### 4.Your Budget

Keep your budget in mind. Some enhancers offer free features, while others may require a purchase or subscription fee for full access. Budgeting effectively ensures you get the best value for your money while achieving great video results.

## Conclusion

The video enhancement landscape has been transformed by artificial intelligence, providing numerous options to enhance your videos' quality. Whether a professional filmmaker or a casual content creator, free AI video enhancers offer a chance to take your productions to the next level.

Each software has unique strengths, from Wondershare Filmora's comprehensive editing features to AVCLabs' neural network-powered upscaling and UniFab's HDR conversion capabilities. User-friendly options like HitPaw cater to beginners while providing robust enhancement tools.

Moreover, for quick fixes or limited storage, online options like Cutout.Pro and Clideo offer accessible solutions with impressive results. With these advancements, achieving professional-quality videos is now achievable for everyone.
