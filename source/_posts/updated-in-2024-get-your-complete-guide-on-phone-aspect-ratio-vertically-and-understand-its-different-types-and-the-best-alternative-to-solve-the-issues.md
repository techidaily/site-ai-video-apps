04 [Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?

Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9\. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.

A video that's portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.

Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it's far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.

Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal **phone aspect ratio vertical**.

## Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens

The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn't be mistaken for 'display/screen size' calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.

The **phone aspect ratio vertical** is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It's also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.

It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16/9.

**Types of Aspect ratio**

**●**   **16:9 Aspect Ratio**

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.

It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.

![16:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone2.jpg)

Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.

On the other hand, you'll experience the "**Letterboxing effect**" on devices that aren't available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars/bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.

![letterbox image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone3.jpg)

**●**   **18:9 Aspect ratio**

This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.

The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be "black bands" at the top, bottom or to your display's right or left.

![18:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg)

The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.

**●**   **19:9 Aspect ratio**

19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.

The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you'll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.

**Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions**

Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google/Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16\. (16:9 standing up!) and it's the ideal size for **iPhone vertical video dimensions**.

The highest quality vertical video's output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).

The highest quality vertical video's output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).

**Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video**

Let's now understand the **mobile vertical video size**! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.

![video aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone5.jpg)

Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!

It's because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.

## Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?

Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9\. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.

A video that's portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.

Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it's far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.

Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal **phone aspect ratio vertical**.

## Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens

The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn't be mistaken for 'display/screen size' calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.

The **phone aspect ratio vertical** is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It's also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.

It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16/9.

**Types of Aspect ratio**

**●**   **16:9 Aspect Ratio**

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.

It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.

![16:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone2.jpg)

Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.

On the other hand, you'll experience the "**Letterboxing effect**" on devices that aren't available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars/bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.

![letterbox image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone3.jpg)

**●**   **18:9 Aspect ratio**

This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.

The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be "black bands" at the top, bottom or to your display's right or left.

![18:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg)

The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.

**●**   **19:9 Aspect ratio**

19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.

The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you'll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.

**Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions**

The highest quality vertical video's output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).

The highest quality vertical video's output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).

**Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video**

Let's now understand the **mobile vertical video size**! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.

![video aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone5.jpg)

_“How good is CyberLink PowerDirector when it comes to automatic color matching?”_

CyberLink is one of the best video editors with features including motion tracking, screen recording, Multicam editing, etc. It further consists of tools such as titles, transitions, and effects to use quickly. However, we need to talk here about the **PowerDirector color match** process and assess its easiness. No matter how good a video editor is, the process must be simple to understand for the primary users. So, let’s begin with the step-by-step guide on how to color match different video clips in PowerDirector.

The Color Match feature of CyberLink PowerDirector allows matching tones and colors on selected video clips.

## Part 1: How to Color Match Different Video Clips in PowerDirector?

Applying color match/color correction to different clips at the same time also speeds up your workflow.

**Step 1: Download ColorDirector**

The first step to effectively do color matching in CyberLink PowerDirector is to download the ColorDirector. It contains a real camera and color effects to achieve cinematic color match editing.

**Step 2: Apply Presets to multiple clips on singletrack**

We assume that you already have clips imported into the timeline. Thus, do a left-click on the first clip, select **Fix/Enhance** tab, and then choose **ColorDirector** in the preview window.

**Step 3: Make manual adjustments**

Yes, you are required to make manual adjustments by clicking the **Manual** and **Adjustments** tab in the preview window.

You can now make some adjustments to **RGB Channel**, as here we have made it a little darker.

After you’re over with the manual adjustment, click **Back** to go back to the PowerDirector. Now, you can see that an adjustment is made to the selected clip.

Then, you need to click **Apply to All** and see the effect getting added to all the clips on the same track.

**Step 4: Apply color match adjustments at different tracks**

Again, apply the same process by left-clicking the video clip on a different track. Select **Fix/Enhance** and then go to **Color Director**.

Now, make some adjustments to the **RBG Channel** as we have made it a little brighter here. Then, you need to save this adjustment as Preset to apply to multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks. Hit the **Create** \> **Preset** tab as shown in the image below.

Then, you can name the **Preset** and hit on **Save** tab.

After you go back to the PowerDirector, you can see your recently-saved preset in the **Presets** list.

Now, select multiple clips. Left-click on a clip, hold the **Ctrl** key, then left-click on another clip while holding the **Ctrl** key, and so on. You will be able to choose more than one clip in this manner.

Then, check the **Color Presets/CLUTs** tab and select the **Preset** that you have saved to apply on multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks.

So, these were the steps of **PowerDirector color match** manual adjustments. We have only adjusted **RGB Channel**, but there are many others to look for and consider.

## Part 2: An Easier Solution to Automatically Matching the Color of Video Footage

Although called professional, it isn’t difficult for a beginner if you know J-Cuts and L-Cuts.

They are nothing but the transition between the video and audio at different times and are entirely separate from wipes and fades. Such video editing technique helps in maintaining visual continuity. These super basic cuts are a combination of dialogue and imagery, thus keeping the video flow without a monotonous feeling.

When you look at the above interface, you will see the basic phenomenon behind the two split cuts. In L-Cuts, although the first video ends, the audio continues to clip two as well.

**Step 4: Final Cut Pro J-Cuts**

In the case of Final Cut Pro **J-Cuts**, the process is reverse, where you need to detach the audio of the preceding or following video clip and drag the first video to the right.

These super basic cuts are a combination of dialogue and imagery, thus keeping the video flow without a monotonous feeling.

When you look at the above interface, you will see the basic phenomenon behind the two split cuts. In L-Cuts, although the first video ends, the audio continues to clip two as well.

## Part 2: FAQ about Education Animation Software

### 1\. How do you make an educational animation video?

If you have set out to make an animation as a teaching aid, then you need the correct type of educational animation software to get you started. Up there with the greats are Renderforest, who let you make tutorials in child-friendly, fun fashion, and Filmora which features all sorts of other plugins to allow you to tailor the suite that you need.

Using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can replace After Effects, work with a Mac to edit footage, or create animations. There are limitless possibilities with this program – but it does let you create educational animation software pieces that will satisfy even the perfectionists out there.

### 2\. Why is the animation used in education?

The Institute of Progressive Education estimates several reasons why animation helps children learn better. At an early age, the bright color and bold shapes of cartoons help us develop recognition, understand words, and even tell time.

As we grow up, animation triggers the centers of the brain that work best for visual learning. When we insert a moral into a cartoon, it is also more often remembered because of the visuals. It is like the difference between seeing a film and reading a summary of the film.

Educational Animation Software is the tool we use to help create educational animations. It is playing more and more of a role in the teaching world, the deeper we go into the digital age.

### 3\. What are the benefits of using animation in teaching and learning of science subjects?

Animation allows students to develop their understanding by applying rational thinking to their imagination.

Educational Animation software has an especially important place in the teaching of science because it will enable children to understand what is going on at a microscopic level.

It does this by recreating things that cannot be seen by the naked eye. There was a study into this in the Journal of Life Science Education, which focused on cell biology education.

By showing cell mitosis in a cartoon, the teachers can communicate actions that they would never get to see.

### 4\. What makes a good educational video?

**Instructive recordings** have become a significant piece of advanced education, giving a significant substance conveyance device in many flipped, mixed, and online classes.

Successful utilization of video as an instructive device is improved when educators think about three components: how to deal with a psychological heap of the video, how to boost understudy commitment with the video, and how to advance dynamic gaining from the video.

This exposition audits writing applicable to every one of these standards and proposes viable ways educators can utilize these standards when using video as an instructive device.

All three components together answer the question of how to make animated educational videos.

### 5\. Which animation software is best for beginners?

Irrespective of whether these are just your initial steps in the field of animation, it is important to experiment.

So, knowing about alternative software or better ones from what you are using now is much required. You can also look for software that may bring in more versatility to your work. There are always different ways of improving what you are already doing.

Some of the [best animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) includes Adobe character animator, Cartoon Animator 4, Stop Motion Studio, DigiCel FlipBook, Moho Pro, and Moho Debut, Toon Boom Harmony, Blender, Pencil2D, Synfig Studio, Animaker, Vyond, Moovly, Wideo, and more.

## Conclusion

There are a plethora of educational animation apps and sites that help the students to make their video presentations interesting and exciting. They do not just enjoy creating animation for educational purposes but also use it as a tool to enhance their creative ability and share their creations on the global platform.

### 1\. How do you make an educational animation video?

If you have set out to make an animation as a teaching aid, then you need the correct type of educational animation software to get you started. Up there with the greats are Renderforest, who let you make tutorials in child-friendly, fun fashion, and Filmora which features all sorts of other plugins to allow you to tailor the suite that you need.

Using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can replace After Effects, work with a Mac to edit footage, or create animations. There are limitless possibilities with this program – but it does let you create educational animation software pieces that will satisfy even the perfectionists out there.

### 2\. Why is the animation used in education?

The Institute of Progressive Education estimates several reasons why animation helps children learn better. At an early age, the bright color and bold shapes of cartoons help us develop recognition, understand words, and even tell time.

As we grow up, animation triggers the centers of the brain that work best for visual learning. When we insert a moral into a cartoon, it is also more often remembered because of the visuals. It is like the difference between seeing a film and reading a summary of the film.

Educational Animation Software is the tool we use to help create educational animations. It is playing more and more of a role in the teaching world, the deeper we go into the digital age.

### 3\. What are the benefits of using animation in teaching and learning of science subjects?

Animation allows students to develop their understanding by applying rational thinking to their imagination.

Educational Animation software has an especially important place in the teaching of science because it will enable children to understand what is going on at a microscopic level.

It does this by recreating things that cannot be seen by the naked eye. There was a study into this in the Journal of Life Science Education, which focused on cell biology education.

By showing cell mitosis in a cartoon, the teachers can communicate actions that they would never get to see.

### 4\. What makes a good educational video?

**Instructive recordings** have become a significant piece of advanced education, giving a significant substance conveyance device in many flipped, mixed, and online classes.

Successful utilization of video as an instructive device is improved when educators think about three components: how to deal with a psychological heap of the video, how to boost understudy commitment with the video, and how to advance dynamic gaining from the video.

This exposition audits writing applicable to every one of these standards and proposes viable ways educators can utilize these standards when using video as an instructive device.

All three components together answer the question of how to make animated educational videos.

### 5\. Which animation software is best for beginners?

Irrespective of whether these are just your initial steps in the field of animation, it is important to experiment.

So, knowing about alternative software or better ones from what you are using now is much required. You can also look for software that may bring in more versatility to your work. There are always different ways of improving what you are already doing.

Some of the [best animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) includes Adobe character animator, Cartoon Animator 4, Stop Motion Studio, DigiCel FlipBook, Moho Pro, and Moho Debut, Toon Boom Harmony, Blender, Pencil2D, Synfig Studio, Animaker, Vyond, Moovly, Wideo, and more.

## Conclusion

There are a plethora of educational animation apps and sites that help the students to make their video presentations interesting and exciting. They do not just enjoy creating animation for educational purposes but also use it as a tool to enhance their creative ability and share their creations on the global platform.
