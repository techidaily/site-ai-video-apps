 Wax is a light weight but high performance and flexible video editing, composition and special effects software. And above all, it's a free video editor for both commercial and personal use. Wax can create 2D & 3D special effects and can work in two modes - as a standalone application and as a "plug-in" to video editors/NLEs like VirtualDub, Sony Vegas, Adobe Premiere, etc.

 This is the getting-started tutorial for Wax. In this Wax tutorial, we are going to show you how to zoom, crop and pan video and image, how to make project settings and how to render AVI videos.

#### 1. Zoom, crop and pan image for video

 Download Wax and install it first. Run the software and Load Media Files by right-clicking on MediaPool panel. But this doesn't finish. To edit video, you need to drag-n-drop desired media files to the timeline. Then switch to Video Plugins to drag-n-drop Quick 3d plugin to the just added track.
