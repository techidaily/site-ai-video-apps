It's official! Apple will now start making in-house processors for Macs based on ARM 64-bit architecture, proving to be faster and much more efficient than its previous models. With all that, there might be a problem. Any software that does not support the new Apple M1 chip may not be compatible with Apple devices. But Wondershare has taken care of that small inconvenience.

## Maximizing FCPX Efficiency: Troubleshooting Strategies for Editors

# Troubleshooting Tips for Final Cut Pro X

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Most of the time, Final Cut Pro X works great. But, when it doesn't, here are some things you can try to get your system back to normal in no time.

Here's the quick list:

* [Quit and restart Final Cut Pro](#part1)
* [Check your media](#part2)
* [Delete render files and re-render](#part3)
* [Create a new library](#part4)
* [Create a new user account](#part5)
* [Trash FCP X Preferences](#part6)
* [Remove and re-install Final Cut Pro](#part7)

#### 1 Quit and restart Final Cut Pro

Restarting Final Cut releases and refreshes memory so that if something was confusing your system, restarting Final Cut can fix it.

![restart fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/restart.png "restart fcp")

#### 2 Check your media

![check your media](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/image-size.png "check your media")

Frequently, problems are caused by still images that are too big. Limit your digital photos to no more than 5,000 pixels on a side. Final Cut is a video editor, not a still image editor. Images that are too large cause problems.

Also, stock footage files are known to cause problems. Be sure to convert all stock footage to ProRes 422 before importing into Final Cut Pro X.

#### 3 Delete render files and re-render

Open your Project in the Timeline and choose File > Delete Project Render Files. Render files can become corrupt. Trashing them forces Final Cut to create new render files which often will fix the problem.

#### 4 Create a new library

Create a new library and a new project. Then, copy and paste sections of the old project into the new project. Test each section until you find the spot that doesn't work. At which point, you can remove or replace the bad media.

![Create a new library](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-project.png "Create a new library")

#### 5 Create a new user account

![Create a new user account](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-ccount.png "Create a new user account")

Open System Preferences > Accounts and create a new User Account. This resets all preferences for both Final Cut and the operating system back to factory defaults. The only problem with doing this is that a new user account can't access files stored in the Home directory of the old user account. For this reason, I always recommend storing all libraries on external hard drives, not the Home Directory.

#### 6 Trash FCP X Preferences

Trash Final Cut Pro X preference files. There are at least three preference files and, if you've had a crash, there can be more. Here are the steps:

* Go to the Finder.
* Hold down on the Option key and click on the Go menu. The Library folder inside your Home Directory now shows up as a selection inside this menu. (You could also type Shift+Command+G, or select Go > Go To Folder in the Finder; then, type \~/Library/ and click Go.)
* Open to the Library > Preferences folder.
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.LSSharedFileList.plist
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.plist
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.UserDestinations.plist
* Trash any other files that start with "com.apple.finalcut".
* Empty the Trash.
* Restart Final Cut Pro X.

#### 7 Remove and reinstall Final Cut Pro

If all else fails, delete FCPX from the Applications folder and re-install it from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12).

One of these techniques should fix your problem. If not, it's time to contact [Apple Support](http://www.apple.com/support/).

**\# Recommendation:**

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## Best Split Screen Video Editor [Online & Offline]

# Best Split Screen Video Editor \[Online & Offline\]

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

The effect that comes up after adding two or more screens in a single frame is called split screen, and the tool that enables the users to do this is a **split screen video editor**. These split screens have significant importance in post-production tasks. That said, the following sections discuss about the tools that enable you to create split screen videos, and explain the process of doing so.

As mentioned above, the split screen effect lets you add two or more screens in a single frame. When multiple activities occur at the same time but at different locations, they all can be shown on one screen by placing their corresponding footages side-by-side or in any other arrangement that the **split screen video maker** allows.

## Best Split Screen Video Editing Software for Windows and Mac \[Free & Paid\]

After understanding what split screen is, it becomes both obvious and mandatory to know about some of the most used **split screen video editor** applications, and how they help you in adding the effect to your movies. Following is a list of a couple of such programs:

### 1. iMovie

A proprietary of Apple, iMovie is available for both iOS and macOS, and is absolutely free of cost. Even though the tool lacks some advanced options for fine editing, it still offers a good platform to those planning their career in post-production industry. With simple UI, it is easy to learn iMovie.

The step-by-step instructions given below explain [how to use iMovie to add split screen effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to your videos:

**Step 1: Add Footages** **to iMovie**

After importing the footages to the Media Bin in iMovie, drag the first one to the Timeline, and then drag the second one above the first layer.

**Step 2: Select the Split Screen Effect**

Select the top video layer in the Timeline, and choose **Split Screen** from the screen type drop-down list at the top.

**Step 3: Select Split Screen Preset**

Choose a position for the selected layer from the **Position** drop-down list at the top, and use the **Slide** slider to adjust the speed of the appearance of the footage.

**Pros**

* iMovie is free to download and use
* The program is available for both macOS and iOS

**Cons**

* Allows only up to two videos to be used in split screen

You can get iMovie from here: <https://www.apple.com/in/imovie/>

### 2. [Wondershare Filmora Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Click **ADVANCED** from the bottom-right area of the **Media** pane, on the **Advanced Split Screen Edit** box, drag the first video from the left pane, and drop it on your preferred section in the right.

### FAQs About Split Screen Video Editors

#### Why you should use split screen effect in video?

There are a couple of reasons you may want to use split screen effect in your video. Some of the most common uses include:

* Showing multiple actions by the same or different characters at the same time, without changing the screen
* Comparing multiple objects or picture quality. This can be done only when the entities in question are placed side-by-side
* Making your video look more professional
* Showing different effects on the same screen

#### Can I create a split screen video with Windows Movie Maker or Windows 10 Photos app?

No, you cannot. Although these tools enable you to resize the videos, since they donâ€™t allow multi-tracked Timelines, no video clips can be placed one above the other which is an essential part for any **split screen video maker** to create the effect. However, as discussed above, there are several post-production tools, offline and online, that allow you to make split screen videos easily and without any cost.

**Conclusion**

[**Split screen video editor**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) tools are both paid and free. Regardless of the program you use to create the effect, the output files always look more professional and informative. Furthermore, things become way simpler if the **split screen video maker** has simple UI, is less resource intensive, and is easy to use as it is the case with Wondershare Filmora.
