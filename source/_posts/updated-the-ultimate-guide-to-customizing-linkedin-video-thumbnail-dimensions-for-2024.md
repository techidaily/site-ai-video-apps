**●** Format of the image: JPG or PNG

**●** Maximum size of the image: 2MB

**●** Aspect Ratio: The aspect ratio of the thumbnail should match that of the video itself.

## Part 2 Publishing videos on LinkedIn

If you are planning to publish a video on LinkedIn, the first thing to know is the place where it will be published. LinkedIn allows adding the videos on the personal feed as well as on the Company pages.

If you are into an established business or a brand having a large number of followers, paid video posts on the company page work best.

For the small- setups and businesses who are looking to promote their products and brands posting a video on the personal feed is a good idea. Initially, you can start by posting on your feed and then can later create a company page.

#### **Difference between Rewind and Reverse:**

#### **Reverse:**

The word reverse as the name reflects, means that we can play a video from its end towards the initial position. Yes, it is possible to reverse the order of video frames in order to arrange them in such a way that last frame appears first following the reverse sequence so that first frame goes to the last position in the clip.

#### **Rewind:**

On the other side rewind is also an interesting feature for video editing where users simply duplicate the clip in form of a segment or make adjustments over range selection and then rewind that particular segment at a speed many times faster than the original speed of clip. After this they play segment of original clip in normal speed towards forward direction.

Although it is possible to get the rewind effect in videos with simple reverse option but still Apple platform supports both of these as standalone options.

The cameras on iPhones and Android phones enable us to capture high-resolution footage with a single tap, but the videos we record with our Smartphones are not always perfect. **Vertical video editing apps** provide a simple solution to these issues, as they allow their users to edit their footage just moments after they recorded it.

The ease of use, the number of available video editing options, or the ease of use are some of the aspects we considered while choosing the vertical video app we included in this article. So, let’s take a look at what the best vertical video apps for iOS and Android devices have to offer.

## The Best Vertical Video Apps for iOS and Android Devices

Being able to post content to your social media pages from wherever you go can help you attract a large number of followers. However, in order to do that, you will need a reliable [video editing application](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that has all the tools you need to polish a video and adjust its aspect ratio to the demands of the social media network to which you want to post it. Here are some of the **best vertical video apps** you can find on Google Play or App Store.

Note: The vertical editing apps are listed in no particular order.

### 1. [Quik](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/quik-app-video-photo-editor)

**Price:** Free

![ Quik Vertical Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quik.JPG)

Content creators that often shoot their videos at outdoor locations with [GoPro cameras](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are going to love using the Quik app because it enables them [to edit their footage](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) while they are on the go. You can combine up to 75 videos and photos, and Quik will analyze them automatically and apply corrections wherever it is needed.

The app also grants you access to more than twenty themes that contain transitions and graphics, so that you can just upload the footage you want to include in a project and Quik will do the rest for you. Each of these themes is fully customizable and you can easily trim a video clip, [alter its playback speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or set a preferred aspect ratio.

**What We Love About Quik:**

* The automated video editing process
* Voice detection feature

### 2. [Vue](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vue-video-editor-slideshow/id1458609369)

The app’s video editing options are as impressive as its video recording capabilities, since cutting, trimming or merging videos and photos requires a minimum amount of effort.

There are more than fifty video filters available in the app’s effects library while [adding a text overlay to a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) requires only a few taps.

**Frequently Asked Questions About Vertical Video Apps for iOS And Android Devices**

**1\. How to edit a vertical video?**

Editing a vertical video is not much different than editing a horizontal video, as you need to remove the parts of the footage you don’t want to include in your project, enhance the colors in a video or add transitions between shots.

**2\. How to change the video’s orientation from horizontal to vertical in iMovie?**

Rotating a video in iMovie is a simple task that can be completed with a single tap. You just have to select a clip you want to rotate on the timeline and then go to the Crop window and rotate your video for 90-degrees.
