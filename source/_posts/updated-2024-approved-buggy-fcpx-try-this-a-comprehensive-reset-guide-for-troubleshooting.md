## How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?

Final Cut Pro X can be really exciting to use if you also get to know the solutions to reset the video editing tool. There can be several reasons as listed above due to which you may require resetting the tool. Here are a few common methods that can fix the problems and reset the software tool as a whole. We have explained the methods with the help of screenshots for your better understanding.

### Method 1: Locating the Preferences

You will require locating the preferences when the Final Cut Pro X keeps crashing. Usually, this program has five different locations where it stores preferences and settings, and that’s from where you can delete the right ones. Located in the library folder, you will find a sub-category of the root level library preferences folder containing the Final Cut Pro System Support folder.

The custom settings folder will contain the presets which you will have to delete. As soon as you find the right folder, you can begin trashing. You can drag the folders to the Trash and empty them then re-open the Final Cut Pro X to see if the problem is settled. If it isn’t, try deleting some more and keep checking the software tool.

### Method 2: Deleting Render Files

Do remember to save your important files before you do this. [Click here to see How to Save Final Cut Pro Project the Right Way？](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This can come in handy when your timeline does not share or render, or simply crash during playback of the rendered area. These render files in Final Cut Pro X seem to be particularly vulnerable to corruption. If you face any troubles during export or rendering, you should instead delete them in the first place. It should be your first action. In order to successfully do so, you can select the project in the browser and choose the file. After that, you can delete the generated project files.

You can begin deleting the files with just a few unused items, but if you feel that you face more trouble you can delete all the files instead. However, you will not have to delete optimized media or proxy. If the problem remains, you can delete the generated files from the Library or the event.

### Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder

This method can be useful if the library corrupts. You should consider transferring your events to a freshly created Library. The majority of the time, this would resolve the problem. If you cannot open the Library, you can eliminate some specific generated items under the Library bundle’s root level. Ideally removing “Setting.plist” and “CurrentVersion.flexolibrary” are the safe options for removal, which can likely open the Library.

## Final Word

Final Cut Pro X can be a very helpful video editing tool until it acts up. Regardless of the reasons for a crashing program, you should consider implementing any of the aforementioned methods to reset the editor, troubleshoot the problems, and seamlessly edit your videos in the long run.

It’s a free online service with 30+ video codecs ensuring support to all prominent video formats, such as MOV, WEBM, MP4, WMV, AVI, and more.

You can follow these steps to stabilize your shaky video without paying a cent:

**" 1:** Go to the 123 Apps Online Video Stabilizer website. Click on the “Open File” button to upload your video. Depending on the internet speed and video size, the upload might take a few seconds to several minutes. However, you should remember that this platform only allows uploading 700MB of video.

**Step 2:**  After uploading the video, activate the tool and choose the portion of the video that you need to stabilize. Once selected, click the “Play” button to see the results.

**Step 3:**  Next, choose your output video format from the options by selecting the gear icon. By default, the tool is set to MP4 output, so make sure to change it if you want to download the video in your preferred format.

**Step 4:**  Click the “Save” button to export your video to your Mac or Windows OS.

#### 6. MP4Compress

![mp4compress](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/mp4compress.png)

Don’"get confused by the name, as this online tool is a gateway to numerous video editing solutions. MP4Compress helps you stabilize shaky footage with ease. Plus, it has many more features to help you make the video look more professional.

For example, the core feature is video conversion to different formats. Likewise, you can compress the videos, make them greyscale, and remove the sound. Contrarily, if you want to stabilize the video through MP4Compress, here’s what you need to do:

**Step 1:** Go to the website, click the “Select file…” button, and choose the video you want that’s troubling you with its shakiness. Keep in mind that you can only upload MP4 files (500MB maximum).

So, if you have a video in other video formats, you will need to convert it into MP4 first.

**Step 2:**  After selecting the video, click the “Upload Video File” button to start the process.

**Step 3:**  Once this tool corrects the shaky video, save it on your computer.

#### 7. Stabilizo

![stabilizo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/stabilizo.png)

Stabilizo is another pick to stabilize shaky videos online for free. While the software also offers other services like a PDF converter and video compressor, the tool is famous for stabilizing videos recorded on different devices.

Usually, it takes a few minutes to work on the video, but it depends on the size of your footage and internet speed. If the video is recorded at a high resolution or you have slow internet, Stabilizo might take more than 5 minutes to do the job.

This is how the tool works:

**Step 1:** Go to the website and click the “Browse” button to select the video you want to stabilize.

**Step 2:** Click the “Upload Video” button to upload the video (500MB max) on the tool and wait until the software stabilizes the video.

**Step 3:** Once it’s completed, click the “Download File” button to save the video on your computer.

#### 8. VideoUtils

![videoutils](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/videoutils.png)

VideoUtils is a complete pack of great tools for online video editing. You can rely on this free web-based program for audio, image, video, and even PDF editing. Nevertheless, you can simply check the “Video Stabilizer” tool to correct the shakiness you’ve got in your video during recording.

It has a simple interface and is also a bit familiar with previous video stabilizing tools mentioned in this list. But unlike most, this online stabilizer supports various video formats, such as AVI, MOV, MP4, WEBM, and MKV.
