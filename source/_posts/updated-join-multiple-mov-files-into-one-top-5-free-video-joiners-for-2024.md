## Stop Motion in the Cloud: A Guide to Tools and Options

Creating a stop motion video is a fascinating process. If you use the right software and know the basics of making videos, you can create fantastic animations. While creating a stop motion video, there are things to keep in mind, like keeping the cameras steady and using the proper audio effects. Cloud Stop motion is well-known software with the tools to create unique video projects on your smartphone, laptop, desktop, Chromebook, or even tablet.

## Part 1\. Introduction- Cloud Stop Motion

It is easy to create stop motion animation with this web-based app. To use cloud stop motion you must first create an account and grant the app permission to your computer's webcam. Then you can start a new project and start taking pictures.

Each image is displayed on the timeline to know all photos that are going to be included in the stop motion video. On Cloud Stop Motion, you have the option to either record or import audio files from the sound library or your device. You can add additional things, like opening titles, end credits, speech bubbles, and text overlays. It functions directly in the browser on any modern device.

You do not have to install anything. It is all saved to the cloud. You can work with your animation on a zoomable, scrollable timeline.

Features -

* Easy to use, powerful, and intuitive software to create animations.
* The Interface has a modern design.
* It is equipped with a rich audio library, backgrounds and styles included.
* You can switch devices seamlessly at any point.

## Part 2\. How to Use Cloud Stop Motion to Create Animation Videos?

Cloud Stop Motion is a great browser-based app that one can use to create fun animation videos. You can use Cloud Stop Motion even when you have not created your account. But consider creating an account to enjoy additional features.

![cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Before you open Cloud Stop Motion and start clicking pictures of your subject for your video, it is important to have a story in mind. So, create a storyboard to break down your stop motion video. You can sketch your plan frame by frame or write bulleted list of your frames. It will help you create your project efficiently, ensuring that you have taken pictures of all the frames that you need to tell your story.

![adding new project on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-project-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Step 1: Once you have created your storyboard, open the app to go to the Cloud Stop Motion dashboard. Click on the new project button. Cloud Stop Motion needs access to your camera for capturing images. So, allow camera access.

![allowing access to camera on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/allowing-access-to-camera-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

On the dashboard, go to the taking picture menu. Now place the subject at the center of your frame. Capture a few test shots to find the composition that you like. You can see the picture at the bottom of the timeline. If needed, adjust the position of your subject. Make sure that the location you choose has plenty of light. If not, you also use a lamp for good light.

Tip: Keeping your phone or camera steady while making your stop-motion project is the key. You can use a tripod, a selfie stick, or a gimbal to keep your device as still as possible. If you don't own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.

Step 2: Move your subject or change its position and take a picture. Repeat the process until you complete your story. To make your stop-motion smooth, make small changes to the position of your subject between shots.

![capturing images on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/capturing-images-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

You can also add more frames per second. Generally, you should add 10 frames per second. But you can go for 25 frames per second to make a smoother video. All the pictures you snap are automatically added to the editor in chronological order.

Step 3: Once you have captured images for your project, add sound by going to the sound menu in the top left of the dashboard. You can record sounds, upload sounds, or select sounds from Cloud Stop Motion's gallery. You can also add text to your Cloud Stop Motion project if you want.

Step 4: Click on play button to preview your project and see if your motion picture turned out as per your liking or not. If you do not like something, go back and make changes. Once done, download your video from cloudstop motion.

Before you open Cloud Stop Motion and start clicking pictures of your subject for your video, it is important to have a story in mind. So, create a storyboard to break down your stop motion video. You can sketch your plan frame by frame or write bulleted list of your frames. It will help you create your project efficiently, ensuring that you have taken pictures of all the frames that you need to tell your story.

![adding new project on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-project-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Step 1: Once you have created your storyboard, open the app to go to the Cloud Stop Motion dashboard. Click on the new project button. Cloud Stop Motion needs access to your camera for capturing images. So, allow camera access.

On the dashboard, go to the taking picture menu. Now place the subject at the center of your frame. Capture a few test shots to find the composition that you like. You can see the picture at the bottom of the timeline. If needed, adjust the position of your subject. Make sure that the location you choose has plenty of light. If not, you also use a lamp for good light.

Tip: Keeping your phone or camera steady while making your stop-motion project is the key. You can use a tripod, a selfie stick, or a gimbal to keep your device as still as possible. If you don't own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.

Step 2: Move your subject or change its position and take a picture. Repeat the process until you complete your story. To make your stop-motion smooth, make small changes to the position of your subject between shots.

![capturing images on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/capturing-images-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

You can also add more frames per second. Generally, you should add 10 frames per second. But you can go for 25 frames per second to make a smoother video. All the pictures you snap are automatically added to the editor in chronological order.

Step 3: Once you have captured images for your project, add sound by going to the sound menu in the top left of the dashboard. You can record sounds, upload sounds, or select sounds from Cloud Stop Motion's gallery. You can also add text to your Cloud Stop Motion project if you want.

So, in this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the best time-lapse apps for iPhone and Android devices in 2020.

## Best Time-Lapse Apps for Android and iPhone Devices in 2021

The quality of your time-lapse video doesn’t depend only on the number of tools an app offers, which is why you must do everything in your power to record the footage that doesn’t contain camera shakes or any other common mistakes. With that being said, let’s take a look at the five best time-lapse apps you can find on GooglePlay or on the AppStore.

#### 1. [Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.hyperlapsemobile&hl=en)

The app lets you increase the video’s speed up to 32 times, enabling you to create seamless time-lapses, although the video stabilization feature is only available if you’re recording a video at a normal speed. That is why you must ensure that your phone is perfectly stable while the recording is in progress if you want to create a smooth time-lapse. Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile lets you share your creations on Instagram, Facebook, and other popular social media networks or save the time-lapse you’ve created to your phone’s SD card.

Watching the time pass by in front of our eyes is mesmerizing. The fast forwarded scenes of beautiful sunsets, busy streets and all other types of vistas can be found anywhere from Holywood movies to YouTube videos. You don’t need professional camera equipment if you want to create time-lapse videos you can share on your social media accounts because there are plenty of apps that let you create these types of videos directly from your Smartphones. So, in this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the best time-lapse apps for iPhone and Android devices in 2020.

## Best Time-Lapse Apps for Android and iPhone Devices in 2021

The quality of your time-lapse video doesn’t depend only on the number of tools an app offers, which is why you must do everything in your power to record the footage that doesn’t contain camera shakes or any other common mistakes. With that being said, let’s take a look at the five best time-lapse apps you can find on GooglePlay or on the AppStore.

#### 1. [Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.hyperlapsemobile&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android 4.4 or later

**Rating:** 4.2

This Android-based application makes the creation of time-lapse videos look easy. You just have to select the speed at which you want to record a video, choose between 720p and 1080p resolutions and hit the record button. The app lets you increase the video’s speed up to 32 times, enabling you to create seamless time-lapses, although the video stabilization feature is only available if you’re recording a video at a normal speed. That is why you must ensure that your phone is perfectly stable while the recording is in progress if you want to create a smooth time-lapse. Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile lets you share your creations on Instagram, Facebook, and other popular social media networks or save the time-lapse you’ve created to your phone’s SD card.

#### 2. [Slo Mo time lapse vid edit.or](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slo-mo-time-lapse-vid-edit-or/id1198548115?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.0 or later

**Rating:** 4.1

This is a video editing app that doesn’t offer video recording options. However, if you already have the footage you’d like to turn into a time-lapse video, Slo Mo time lapse vid edit.or may be one of the best options you have. Besides creating slow motion and time-lapse videos, you can also use this app to enhance the colors in the footage you’re editing, crop or trim video clips and add customized text overlays to the videos. The app also features a wide spectrum of filters and allows you to add sound effects or music to the video you’re working on. Keep in mind that you have to make an in-app purchase if you want to remove the watermark from your videos or if you want to export your time-lapse and slow-motion videos in Full HD resolution.

#### 3. [Lapse It Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lapse-it-pro-time-lapse-stop-motion-camera-professional-hd/id536495161?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

The app’s render engine exports UHD 4K videos in remarkably short periods of time, so you can quickly share high-quality videos to any of the popular social media networks.

The only downside is that Hyperlapse for Instagram doesn’t offer any video editing tools.
