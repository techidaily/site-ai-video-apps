## Part 1: What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?

The majority of individuals favor OIS over EIS. A hardware approach is always preferable to a software platform since EIS is essentially a repair solution that causes picture resolution deterioration by cutting it and estimating what this would seem like if it were steady. OIS also performs better in low-light conditions. The best video stabilizer app for android is the one that incorporates both approaches.

Today, we all use cameras and cell phones to capture many important events in our lives. Sometimes the recorded videos are shaky due to various factors such as a sudden hand movement, a lack of stabilization in our recording equipment, and so on.

Users can utilize video stabilizer applications to solve this issue. Using these applications, users may quickly smooth out shaky areas of a video on their Android smartphones. However, finding an excellent **Android Video Stabilizer** is still a hard task due to the number of applications present in the market. But don't worry, a few of the best video stabilizers are reviewed in this article. Let's get going!

#### In this article

01 [What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?](#part1)

02 [Best Free Video Stabilizer Apps for Android](#part2)

## Part 1: What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?

The majority of individuals favor OIS over EIS. A hardware approach is always preferable to a software platform since EIS is essentially a repair solution that causes picture resolution deterioration by cutting it and estimating what this would seem like if it were steady. OIS also performs better in low-light conditions. The best video stabilizer app for android is the one that incorporates both approaches.

Moreover, OIS and EIS both hold a significant reputation for video stabilization. And not much, but some people prefer Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) to stabilize their video as it converts the optical signal to a digital one. You will get a better understanding of both the stabilization technologies after reading what's written below:

**Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)**

Electronic image stabilization operates on a fundamentally different premise, with the problem being tackled at the coding layer after the visible light has been transformed to a digital signal.

**Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)**

The picture is stabilized with this approach by altering the optical path of the detector. Because this is real-time correction, no image change or degradation occurs. The lens component is rotated such that it is parallel to the picture plane.

#### **Conclusion:**

Making a meme is about imagination, and having a sense of humor, but you also need a powerful tool that lets you express your ideas in the exact way you want.

## Part 2: How to Add Plugins to Final Cut Pro X

The first step for installing any plugin is to get out of Final Cut Pro X if you have it open. You can refer to the steps below to install various kinds of Final Cut Pro X plugins.

#### Step 1: Download the Plugin

Go to your favorite site of plugins and search for tools. Here, we are referring to download the transition tools. Click the **Add to Cart** tab as shown in the image below.

![top 10 free fcpx plugins download transition tools](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-download-transition-tools.jpg)

You will get its download in the form of a zip folder, which you have to unzip for sure.

Here, we have downloaded two transitions contained within one folder.

#### Step 2: Copy and Paste the Plugin

Now, you need to copy the plugin by right-clicking the entire folder, as shown below.

![top 10 free fcpx plugins copy plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-copy-plugin.jpg)

Afterward, find the **Final Cut Pro X** in **Applications** folder from the **Finder** tab. Right-click the Final Cut Pro X and hit the **Show Package Content** option.

![top 10 free fcpx plugins show package contents](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-show-package-contents.jpg)

Then go to **Contents** \> **Plugins** \> **Media Providers** \> **Motion Effects.fxp** \> **Contents** \> **Resources** \> **Templates** \> **Transitions**.

Paste the item in the **Transition** folder as shown below.

![top 10 free fcpx plugins paste item](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-paste-item.jpg)

Finally, there is one last step you need to do with the original files of the transition plugin.

Hit the first transition from the folder that you have just pasted. And, rename the white file that is the actual transition plugin with extension **.motr**. You are required to do the same thing with other transitions' folders.
