## Mastering Color Grading in Final Cut Pro 2023

# Color Correction in Final Cut Pro

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Most of the advanced camera units these days are capable enough to produce shots with rich quality automatically but still some professionals need to edit captured videos for little color correction. The major reasons behind this additional color correction are:

* Some people need to correct their mistakes on captured videos; it can be due to an incorrect balance of white and due to under or over-exposure at some points.
* Customize different video clips by matching them so that they appear in sequence even if they are captured at different moments.
* For creating a specific style or look in order to support your mood; for example, one may need to make scenes appear cold, dark, cheery, warm, bright or foreboding.

No matter what you want to do for the customization of your videos, Final Cut Pro can provide your complete assistance. The details below can help you to collect complete information about color correction techniques.

## Methods to Correct Color in Final Cut Pro

Those who wish to use FCP for color signal editing need to follow these steps:

#### Step 1

First you need to open **Color Board** on FCP as there is an automatic color correction tool available inside. The Video Board can be opened by using three different ways:

* You can select audio enhancement and color correction options available below the viewer and then hit “Show Color Board”. It can be simply done by pressing **CMD + 6**.

![Show Color Board”. ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-1.png)

* On effect browser you can easily access color correction effects inside the color category; that is also easier to allocate.

![Effect Browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-2.png)

* Choose **Window** and then click on **Go To**, you will find **Color Board** on the appeared drop-down menu.

![Go to Color Board](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-3.png)

* All the color correction effects will start appearing in the effects section available on the video inspector.

![ Color correction effects on video inspector.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-4.png)

#### Step 2

As soon as you start working on **Color Board**, it is good to open Video Scopes on your system. For this you need to click on a small icon of light switch available at the top right corner of the viewer and then select Show Video Scopes from drop-down menu. It can be also done by simply pressing Command+7.

![ select Show Video Scopes from drop down menu.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-5.png)

As soon as you make this selection, the video scopes window will automatically appear on the next viewer. Here users can easily obtain information related to the current video frame, and they can be easily configured as per need. Go to the settings option available on the top right side of the window and then hit the **Waveform** option.

![ Go to settings option available at top right side of window and then hit Waveform option.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-6.png)

#### Step 3

Now it is time to work on color correction directly. There are three types of color corrections that users need to work upon: Hue, Saturation, and Exposure. Here is some brief information about all of these:

**Exposure or Brightness:** On the Color board window you can easily make adjustments for brightness levels of video clips. As you move on to different portions of the image ranging between dark and white parts, the scope will keep on displaying waveforms with values between 0 and 100 representing darkness and brightness respectively. The master slider available on screen helps users to make overall adjustments for brightness by using three control options: highlights for white circles, midtones for gray scale and shadows for black parts. Consider waveform values as a guide for adjustment and move controls up and down to adjust contrast as per need.

![ Exposure or Brightness ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-7.png)

**Saturation:** It refers to the richness of colors in an image. Simply select saturation pane from the color board and on the video scopes window you can use the settings menu directly to adjust saturation information for every pixel. The image pixels that are far away from the center of vectorscope circle means they are more saturated as compared to pixels that are little bit closure.

![ Saturation ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-8.png)

**Hue:**  Hue displays the actual color values in images or frames in terms of primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. Use color pane from color board to adjust hue that is displayed in the form of a rainbow on screen. It is possible to manipulate values for highlights, midtones and shadows individually as per need. Using the histogram option available on settings menu can help you to make direct adjustments for all these components.

#### Step 4

It is possible to preview all the corrections on the original image before making them final. Simple hit the arrow with left-facing formation in the top left corner of the Color Board and then return to the video inspector. Hit on the Blue box to switch between correction On and Off options.

Most of the advanced camera units these days are capable enough to produce shots with rich quality automatically but still some professionals need to edit captured videos for little color correction. The major reasons behind this additional color correction are:

* Some people need to correct their mistakes on captured videos; it can be due to an incorrect balance of white and due to under or over-exposure at some points.
* Customize different video clips by matching them so that they appear in sequence even if they are captured at different moments.
* For creating a specific style or look in order to support your mood; for example, one may need to make scenes appear cold, dark, cheery, warm, bright or foreboding.

No matter what you want to do for the customization of your videos, Final Cut Pro can provide your complete assistance. The details below can help you to collect complete information about color correction techniques.

## Part 1: How to Make a Stop Motion Video on Instagram?

 The technical side of making a stop motion video on Instagram is rather simple since you can enable this feature in just a few taps.

 In addition, the maximum number of frames a stop motion video created with Instagram can have is limited to just ten.

### Frequently Asked Questions: Why Can’t I See the Stop Motion Feature in Instagram Stories?

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still in its beta stage, which means that it isn’t available on all versions of the app. So, if you can’t see this option you must go to Google Play or Apps Store and install the version of Instagram that has this feature. If the issue persists, you should opt for some other stop motion app you can use free of charge. ;

## Part 2: 3 Best Stop Motion Apps you can Use to Create Animated Videos for Instagram

 You shouldn’t worry if the stop motion feature isn’t available on the version of Instagram you’re using, because there are so many apps that are equipped with this tool. With so many different options on the market, finding the app that provides you with all features you need to create stop motion videos can be a difficult task. That’s why we shortlisted the three best apps for iPhones and Android devices that enable you to make animated stop motion videos for Instagram.

### 1\. [Over](https://www.madewithover.com/)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchase

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

 Over allows you to do much more than just create stop motion videos you can post on Instagram since it is equipped with a versatile set of tools that can help you improve the brand awareness on social media. There are more than 700 [templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to choose from and each of them enables you to adjust your photos and videos to the social network’s demands. However, the free version of the app offers only limited capabilities, and you must upgrade to the Pro version if you want to have access to all photo and video editing tools Over have to offer.

### 2\. Mojo

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/mojo-create-video-stories/id1434861974), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=video.mojo)

![create stop motion video for IG in Mojo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mojo-create-video-stories.jpg)

 Creating content for social media with Mojo is a simple process that can be completed in just three easy steps. You don’t even need a Mojo account to start creating stories with this app. All you have to do is select an animated template, import videos or photos and edit it before tapping on the share button. There are more than a hundred animated templates to choose from, so after you pick one, you just have to [add text overlays](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but you must purchase Mojo Pro if you want to [change aspect ratios](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), duplicate stories or have access to all text styles and templates.

### 3\. [Life Lapse](https://www.lifelapseapp.com/)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/life-lapse-stop-motion-camera/id1281464378), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifelapse&hl=en)

![Life Lapse Stop Motion Maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/life-lapse-stop-motion-camera.jpg)

 The fact that more than a million video content creators and brands are using Life Lapse to make stop motion videos says a lot about the app’s capabilities. Unlike Over and Mojo, Life Lapse lets you set the exposure and focus locks, switch on a grid or use the ghosted image overlay. Besides capturing photos and videos, the app also allows you to import photos you want to include in the stop motion animation. Furthermore, even the free version of Life Lapse offers a variety of video editing tools that allow you to crop images or adjust saturation, brightness or white balance values in each frame.

## Part 3: How to Create a Stop Motion Videos with Life Lapse

 You don’t have to be a skilled cinematographer to make a stop motion video using the Life Lapse app. Once you’ve installed and launched Life Lapse you should create a new project by tapping on the + icon. As soon as the camera loads you’ll be asked to choose if you would like to create a photo or a video project. Tap on the photo option and start taking photos of the objects or people you want to include in your stop motion video.

 The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds. Furthermore, changing a video’s aspect ratio to 9:16 is recommended, as it will enable you to know exactly how your stop motion video is going to look like after you upload it to Instagram.

## Part 4: Tips for Creating Stop Motion Videos for Instagram

 The process of making a stop motion animation is not technically complicated since you just need to place your phone on a [tripod](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and take a photo each time you move an object in the shot. Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.

### 1\. Develop a concept

 What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.

### 2\. Shoot in studio conditions

 Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.

**Conclusion**

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos. Which app are you using to create stop motion videos? Leave a comment and let us know.

Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.

### 2\. Shoot in studio conditions

 Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.

**Conclusion**

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos. Which app are you using to create stop motion videos? Leave a comment and let us know.

With so many different options on the market, finding the app that provides you with all features you need to create stop motion videos can be a difficult task. That’s why we shortlisted the three best apps for iPhones and Android devices that enable you to make animated stop motion videos for Instagram.

### 1\. [Over](https://www.madewithover.com/)

### 2\. Mojo

Tap on the photo option and start taking photos of the objects or people you want to include in your stop motion video.

 The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds. Furthermore, changing a video’s aspect ratio to 9:16 is recommended, as it will enable you to know exactly how your stop motion video is going to look like after you upload it to Instagram.

## Part 4: Tips for Creating Stop Motion Videos for Instagram

 The process of making a stop motion animation is not technically complicated since you just need to place your phone on a [tripod](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and take a photo each time you move an object in the shot. Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.

### 1\. Develop a concept
