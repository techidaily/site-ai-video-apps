It’s very common that you filmed some amazing portrait or landscape videos but in the wrong direction. This is an error made by many people because not everyone will always think about orientation when filming. Is there an easy way to flip/rotate videos so that you can watch them without turning your head sideways?

What you need is just an ease to use video editor like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to flip/rotate your video clips easily and quickly. This application offers a remarkably easy way to flip videos clockwise or anticlockwise, horizontal or vertical. What’s more, this flip software also offers a broad range of video editing features, effects and intro/credits.

In the following, I’ll describe how to flip a video in Windows using this video flip program. If you’re a Mac user, just adopt Wondershare Filmora X for Mac (Latest Filmora version X for Mac) to achieve the same.

First, please download Filmora X for free as per your operating system, and then follow the steps below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1. Import Your Original Video Clips

The reality is that these software applications enable artists to create cutting-edge videos.

These tools are adept at everything from PIP to audio addition and effects addition to general video control, with a low-cost means of creating music. When all of these effects are combined, music makers become a must-have for everyone. Continue reading this article to learn about the best **Video Editor with Music** that makes it easier to incorporate music into your videos!

## Part 1: Best Video Editors with Music on Windows and Mac

Whether it's a personal video, a promo, or a cinematic trailer, the audio or song in a video may have a significant impact on our impression of it.

But what if you just have muted footage or a cracked and damaged audio file that has to be repaired, and you would like to add audio to the movie right now? In such a case, you may make things easy for yourself by using the applications listed below!

### 1  Windows 10 Photos App

**Supported System**: Windows 10 and Windows 11

**Pricing:** Free

Microsoft or Windows Photo App, a free photo viewer and editor bundled with Windows 10, provides capable image editing and photo improvements, as well as capabilities for managing and editing video, all in a touch-friendly interface.

You may doodle on photographs, add background music and 3D effects to films, and use automated object tagging to make searching easier. Microsoft Photos is a wonderful tool for working with digital photographs, and for certain users, it may even replace third-party photo applications.

The Windows 10 Photos application's artificial intelligence function allows you to create a video with music automatically with the [**Automatic Video feature**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It's simple to accomplish, what’s more, there are some music track presets in the Photos app, so you can change the background music and edit it further manually.

Besides that, you can also create a new video project from scratch and choose music from its background music library.

**Step 1:** Launch the Photos app, go to **New video** and then click **New Video Project** button at the top of the screen, and then rename the video accordingly.

![windows 10 photos new video project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-10-photos-new-video-project.jpg)

**Step 2:** Click on the **+Add** option to import photos or videos to the project from your PC or collection, and then drop and place them to the storyboard.

![place video image to windows 10 photos storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/place-video-image-to-windows-10-photos-storyboard.jpg)

**Step 3:** Next, from the top-right, press the **Background music** menu, pick one from the list. And the music track will fit to the length of the video automatically. You can enable [**Sync your video to the music’s beat**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to sync music to the beat of a video.

![add background music to windows 10 photo video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-background-music-to-windows-10-photo-video.jpg)

**Step 4:** Then press the **Done** button. This is how you can use the Windows Photos App and add a soundtrack from its background music library to videos. Windows 10 has several benefits, and with the correct tools, you can get the most out of it.

### 2  Apple iMovie

Movavi is a video editing program with a straightforward, user-friendly interface. PiP, chroma-key, titling, adding music to video, basic keyframing, and motion tracking are all included. It isn't as feature-rich or speedy as some competitors, but it allows you to create appealing work quickly.

It's time to begin the post-production procedure when your video capture is finished, and your newly obtained film has been safely transferred from your camcorder to a hard disk. You may alter the audio file of your short video in any manner you like with the Movavi video editor.

**Step 1:** From the welcome box, choose to **Create a projec**t in full feature mode. When you're in the editor, click the **Add Media Files** button to incorporate the video and audio files you want to utilize in your new project.

**Step 2:** Every file you choose will be instantly placed on the Movavi timeline, with video files will appear on the Video Track and audio files on the **Audio Track**. To eliminate the unnecessary section of the audio file, click the **Split** option.

**Step 3**: Simply press **Start** and wait for your movie to be exported after selecting the correct video format and setting the destination folder by deciding on the **Save to** section.

**Conclusion**

Any video without some background soundtrack or any music, in general, appears to be at its 50% percent. Users tend to lose interest soon if they don't have something playing in the background all the time.

This is why the best Video Editor with Music reviewed in this article will ultimately do everything for you.
