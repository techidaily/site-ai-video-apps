## After Effects VS Adobe Premiere, What's the Difference?

# After Effects VS Adobe Premiere, 9 Differences Tell You Which One is Better?

This is perhaps the most asked question regarding video processing on the internet. And looking at the product descriptions on the Adobe site gives us a clue why. There seems to be a large overlap between the two programs, and technically there is, although as we shall see capability doesn't always mean suitability, so the similarities are not quite as pronounced as they would appear.

With that in mind, it is worth looking at the key differences between [After Effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Premiere to get a clearer understanding of what is best for which situation and why you would pick one program over the other. So below are the 9 points that I will make a comparison.

#### Comparison Table

## After Effects VS Adobe Premiere

#### 1Timeline

There are numerous editing differences between the two programs, but we will start with the timeline as it perhaps best illustrates the different focus of each package. Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.

The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere's timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-1.png)

#### 2Editing

In addition to the timeline, Premiere has an interface and toolset built for precise editing and clip manipulation, both audio and video. This is not surprising of course, Premiere is after all first and foremost an editing package. By contrast, whilst there is editing functionality within After Effects, it is neither as user friendly, nor remotely as comprehensive a tool set, and as such would not be a suitable environment for extensive editing workflow.

This is perhaps the crux of the differences between the two packages, for editing work Premiere offers a complete toolset far beyond the requirements for many projects, but as comprehensive as one wishes, whilst After Effects is focus more on composites and motion video work and has an editing tool set that is not conducive to efficiency and ease of use.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-2.png)

#### 3Audio Mixer

In today's market the audio component on a video product can be as important as the visual aspects, the audio clip mixer within Premiere is a professional grade tool designed to offer precise control over a projects audio output and includes the ability to use VST3 industry standard plugins. Because After Effects is primarily a composite application it lacks the finesse of Premiere where audio is concerned. Again this shouldn't be read as being an inferior program, it simply has a different focus.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-3.jpg)

#### 4Mercury Playback Engine

In terms of perceived functionality probably not the top of the list, but Premiere uses this to employ either software (useful) or hardware (brilliant), assuming you have a compatible graphics card, accelerated real time renderless viewing of clips and sequences. This creates a much faster workflow for editing than is possible with After Effects beyond the previously mentioned tools and interface restrictions.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-4.jpg)

#### 5 Multicam

In terms of editing this is where After Effects just isn't comparable at all, the multi camera interface within Premiere is exceptionally featured and allows on the fly angle changes and edits and the ability to sync a single shot through numerous camera simultaneously. As said, the editing functionality on offer here is what Premiere exists for, and whilst both Premiere and After Effects are video manipulation packages, editing and composting are very different focuses, and the products reflect those differences.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-5.jpg)

#### 6Media Management

Often overlooked but very important for project fidelity, the media management facilities within Premiere are designed around the needs of editing production and enable a much easier organizational approach for large projects than that of After Effects.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-6.jpg)

#### 7Masking

This is where After Effects comes to the fore. The ability to create masks that track through scenes is a fundamental component of After Effects workflow and why it is so good for effects creation and compositing. None of these effects are readily achievable within Premiere as it ships, and even add ons will never achieve the fluidity and ease of use the purpose designed interface provides.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-7.jpg)

#### 8 Camera Tracker

The 3D camera tracker within After Effects is an incredibly useful tool designed to replicate the camera movements within a given scene to allow new layers to be added that precisely match the original scene, essential for composite work and simply not possible within Premiere.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-8.jpg)

#### 9 Effects

The collection of specific tools within After Effects for applying motion control effects, for color control, blurring shadows transitions and titles is vast, and whilst Premiere includes some of its own, it is clear that here After Effects has the edge and it once again highlights the different approach taken by each program. Premiere is primarily an editing application, it is designed to enable the fastest, most efficient and highest quality non-linear editing of a project possible. Within that framework it includes the ability, both natively and with plugins, to incorporate a limited range transitions and effects to aid the editing process.

After Effects, however, is an application built around effects, it is designed to allow an almost unlimited variety of effects, transitions and animations to be incorporated into a project via compositing and as such has a wealth of tools to enable the efficient workflow of those tasks, including some editing tools that would likely be needed for that job.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-9.png)

## Conclusion

I've seen it explained before in terms of Word and Excel. You can compose a letter in Excel and create a spreadsheet in Word with the tables functionality, but the end result will take much longer and never be quite as good doing it that way. This perhaps is the best way to explain the relationship between Premiere and After Effects.

Yes, a spec sheet makes the two programs seem somewhat comparable, but it is the focus of each application that shows why they differ so much. Ultimately, the best use of these programs is together, they complement each other perfectly.

## After Effects VS Adobe Premiere

#### 1Timeline

There are numerous editing differences between the two programs, but we will start with the timeline as it perhaps best illustrates the different focus of each package. Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.

The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere's timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-1.png)

#### 2Editing

In addition to the timeline, Premiere has an interface and toolset built for precise editing and clip manipulation, both audio and video. This is not surprising of course, Premiere is after all first and foremost an editing package. By contrast, whilst there is editing functionality within After Effects, it is neither as user friendly, nor remotely as comprehensive a tool set, and as such would not be a suitable environment for extensive editing workflow.

This is perhaps the crux of the differences between the two packages, for editing work Premiere offers a complete toolset far beyond the requirements for many projects, but as comprehensive as one wishes, whilst After Effects is focus more on composites and motion video work and has an editing tool set that is not conducive to efficiency and ease of use.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-2.png)

#### 3Audio Mixer

In today's market the audio component on a video product can be as important as the visual aspects, the audio clip mixer within Premiere is a professional grade tool designed to offer precise control over a projects audio output and includes the ability to use VST3 industry standard plugins. Because After Effects is primarily a composite application it lacks the finesse of Premiere where audio is concerned. Again this shouldn't be read as being an inferior program, it simply has a different focus.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-3.jpg)

#### 4Mercury Playback Engine

In terms of perceived functionality probably not the top of the list, but Premiere uses this to employ either software (useful) or hardware (brilliant), assuming you have a compatible graphics card, accelerated real time renderless viewing of clips and sequences. This creates a much faster workflow for editing than is possible with After Effects beyond the previously mentioned tools and interface restrictions.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-4.jpg)

#### 5 Multicam

In terms of editing this is where After Effects just isn't comparable at all, the multi camera interface within Premiere is exceptionally featured and allows on the fly angle changes and edits and the ability to sync a single shot through numerous camera simultaneously. As said, the editing functionality on offer here is what Premiere exists for, and whilst both Premiere and After Effects are video manipulation packages, editing and composting are very different focuses, and the products reflect those differences.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-5.jpg)

#### 6Media Management

Often overlooked but very important for project fidelity, the media management facilities within Premiere are designed around the needs of editing production and enable a much easier organizational approach for large projects than that of After Effects.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-6.jpg)

#### 7Masking

This is where After Effects comes to the fore. The ability to create masks that track through scenes is a fundamental component of After Effects workflow and why it is so good for effects creation and compositing. None of these effects are readily achievable within Premiere as it ships, and even add ons will never achieve the fluidity and ease of use the purpose designed interface provides.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-7.jpg)

#### 8 Camera Tracker

The 3D camera tracker within After Effects is an incredibly useful tool designed to replicate the camera movements within a given scene to allow new layers to be added that precisely match the original scene, essential for composite work and simply not possible within Premiere.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-8.jpg)

#### 9 Effects

The collection of specific tools within After Effects for applying motion control effects, for color control, blurring shadows transitions and titles is vast, and whilst Premiere includes some of its own, it is clear that here After Effects has the edge and it once again highlights the different approach taken by each program. Premiere is primarily an editing application, it is designed to enable the fastest, most efficient and highest quality non-linear editing of a project possible. Within that framework it includes the ability, both natively and with plugins, to incorporate a limited range transitions and effects to aid the editing process.

After Effects, however, is an application built around effects, it is designed to allow an almost unlimited variety of effects, transitions and animations to be incorporated into a project via compositing and as such has a wealth of tools to enable the efficient workflow of those tasks, including some editing tools that would likely be needed for that job.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-9.png)

## Conclusion

I've seen it explained before in terms of Word and Excel. You can compose a letter in Excel and create a spreadsheet in Word with the tables functionality, but the end result will take much longer and never be quite as good doing it that way. This perhaps is the best way to explain the relationship between Premiere and After Effects.

Yes, a spec sheet makes the two programs seem somewhat comparable, but it is the focus of each application that shows why they differ so much. Ultimately, the best use of these programs is together, they complement each other perfectly.

This is perhaps the most asked question regarding video processing on the internet. And looking at the product descriptions on the Adobe site gives us a clue why. There seems to be a large overlap between the two programs, and technically there is, although as we shall see capability doesn't always mean suitability, so the similarities are not quite as pronounced as they would appear.

With that in mind, it is worth looking at the key differences between [After Effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Premiere to get a clearer understanding of what is best for which situation and why you would pick one program over the other. So below are the 9 points that I will make a comparison.

#### Comparison Table

## Vegas alternative for Windows

#### 1\. Adobe Premiere Elements - A Program like Sony Vegas

When a product is branded with Adobe, it means high quality, better performance, and consistency with another program by Adobe. [Adobe Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html) is a **good Vegas alternative for Windows** (Mac version also available).

![sony vegas alternative adobe premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-elements-2021-interface.png)

For professionals, Adobe Premiere Pro is the better Sony Vegas alternative for Windows. It's the higher version of Premiere Element with differences in capturing, timeline editing, multiple sequence editing, DVD menu, surround sound mixing, etc.

#### 2\. ZS4 Video Editor - Free Alternative to Sony Vegas in Windows

[ZS4 Video Editor](http://www.zs4.net/news) is a free Sony Vegas alternative for Windows, Mac and Linux. It is the new incarnation of the free Zwei-Stein Video Editor. It comes with simple video editing tools and 150 video effects, but the interface is not so user-friendly. Compared to Wondershare [Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Adobe Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html), ZS4 Video Editor is not the common video editing software, but free is the most important factor for this Sony Vegas alternative.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great tool for video creators. This dedicated software offers its users numerous different features that are aimed at making your video content better. It is widely loved by users for its prestigious and easy-to-use features.

However, much to many people’s dismay, Filmora is not free. But would you like to acquire the **Filmora free** version on your device? Would you like to download the Wondershare Filmora video editor for free and edit videos or photos without paying $49.99 annually? If so, here are some solutions to getting Filmora video editors completely free without violating the law.

* [Part 1: Getting Filmora Full Version for Free via Taking Mission](#part1)
* [Part 2: Most Easy and Creative Features in Filmora (You Should Definitely Try)](#part2)

## Part 1: Getting Filmora for Free via Taking the Mission to Export 3 Videos

Another method is for users who have already installed Filmora on their devices. If you are using Filmora, you do not need to crack it in order to get **Filmora free**. You can earn the Filmora license by doing the mission of exporting three videos in total from the software. The method is quite simple and easy, but the mission is only available for Filmora 10.2 and above versions for a limited time. And the mission may be taken down sometime.

In order to do so, you have to follow the steps mentioned below.

[![Download Filmora X Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora X Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* To begin with, you need to download and install Filmora, and then launch Filmora and then click New Project to create a new project. Then you will see a pop-up window as shown below:

![ Filmora mission ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-filmora-for-free-take-mission.jpg)

Wondershare Filmora provides a 7-day license for users without Filmora subscription, and a perpetual effects pack for users already subscribed to it. Click the Take the Mission button to continue, and you will see the progress under the right corner.

![ complete Filmora mission ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/complete-mission-to-get-filmora-for-free.jpg)

Now, it’s time to import, edit and export video footage with Filmora. There are several ways to import media to Filmora, and the direct way is drag and drop the photo and video into the Project media library, and then place them in order in the timeline.

![ import  import your media files to Filmora  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/import-media-file-to-filmora-1.jpg)

* If you need to cut out some clips from the footage, you can trim, split, or crop it easily. Right-click the footage in the timeline, and you will find the most commonly used editing tools.
* You can follow the software layout to add audio, titles, transitions, effects, elements accordingly. If you wish to [add sound to your video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), go to "Audio" tab, find the proper music track or sound effect for your footage, and then drag it to the soundtrack in the timeline.

![ add sound effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/select-theme-music.jpg)

* The titles tab provides hundreds of titles and texts templates, including openers, titles, Lower 3rds, subtitles, and end credits. You can also use the Plain text template without animations and add some callouts.
* In the next step, add overlays or [transitions in your video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and if you have finished the editing, press Ctrl+S to save the project.

![ add transitions ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filters-filmora-win.jpg)

* Finally, click on the "Export" button and select the "Local" tab. Choose a name and file format for your video and tap "Export."

![save your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/go-to-export-panel.jpg)

Once you are done with compiling one video, follow the same steps as mentioned above twice more so that you have exported three videos in total from Filmora. You can see your progress in the gift box in the right corner. Click Claim Your Rewards and you will a pop-up window as shown below.

![ claim your Filmora license](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/claim-free-filmora-license.jpg)

Now, click the **Claim your Free 7-day License** button, by doing so, you will get the Filmora License, i.e., your Filmora version is now full and free.

Once you have acquired the **Filmora free** license, you can go back and import the previous projects, edit again and remove the watermark.

Launch Filmora again, and then find the project you just made in the Start window and open it. Or you can click New Project to enter the main interface, click File - Open Recent, find the project. Log in with your Wondershare ID and click on the "Export" button. Your video will now be exported without a watermark.

This method is quite easy to get the **Filmora free** version. But as it said before, it is a 7-day limited license, how about if you want it to be longer? No worries, read on and you will find out how.

## Part 2: Most Easy and Creative Features in Filmora (You Should Definitely Try)

Now you have the **Filmora free** version on your device. That means that you have now successfully gained access to multiple features of Wondershare Filmora for free. Filmora offers its users several unique and creative features that can be used to make your videos top-notch. Mastering these tools requires lots of practice, but the end result is definitely worth it all.

There are various tools offered by Filmora that can help elevate the rank of your videos to make them top-tier, but they are often overlooked. Users generally do not have an idea of how to make the most out of their tool. Here, we have mentioned some of the fun and easy-to-use features offered by Filmora that you should definitely try as an aspiring content creator.

### 1. Filmora Green Screen

The Green Screen effect by Filmora is an advanced feature of the Overlays option. It enables users to combine two overlaid clips in such a way that the background of the lower layer can be visible on the top layer. It uses a color range in the top clip to make it shine through. You can get this effect by using a green background while shooting videos.

[![Download Filmora X Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora X Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The Green Screen effect can be used to place subjects over a number of different backgrounds. You can make a green screen on Filmora by simply clicking on the chroma key. It also offers spill removal, color correction, filters, and transition effects to use on your green screen.

### 2. Filmora Split Screen

The Split Screen feature in Wondershare Filmora allows you to display multiple clips on the screen at the same time. This feature comes in handy when you want to compare different angled shots or add two or more clips to your video. The effect helps users to add a specific style and class into your video.

Filmora currently offers around 30 split screen templates. You can add up to 6 different video clips in these presets at the same time. The default duration of the split screen is 5 seconds, but you can adjust it according to your requirements. You can add all kinds of borders, do a color correction, tuning and apply motion effects on your split-screen.

### 3. Filmora Beat Detection

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** offers a Beat Detection option for users, which marks audio beats from the inserted sound clip in your video automatically. The tool makes it easy to match your edits with the music, allowing a smooth clip. Analyzing and detecting the beats is entirely automatic.

It is an excellent tool for filming, even for people who are first-timers. You can change the highlight beat frequency, offset or add transitions in your beats. This will allow your videos to appear more in-sync and vivid.

#### Conclusion

You can now go on and spread the news. Wondershare Filmora can now be downloaded and used for free without paying any extra money. Using the methods mentioned above, you can get **Filmora free download** on your device without any crack or spending a dollar. Also, try the wonderful features of Filmora to get the most out of your videos and photos.
