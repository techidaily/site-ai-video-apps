## Part 1: What is the Bokeh Effect and Why Should I Be Using it?

The word “Bokeh”or “boke” refers to the Japanese concept of “blur.” It is, in its simplest form, a style of photography where one object is the primary focus, and everything else is strategically blurred.

Using the Bokeh effect is an excellent way to separate the focal point of your photo from non-focal points. It not only serves the purpose of highlighting the focus of the image, but can also help when you’re looking to get rid of an unpleasant or unwanted background. The blurred background is meant to keep your focal point at the absolute center of your audience’s attention.

## Part 2: Top 10 Best Apps to Achieve the Bokeh Effect for iOS and Android

## Part 1: What is the Bokeh Effect and Why Should I Be Using it?

The word “Bokeh”or “boke” refers to the Japanese concept of “blur.” It is, in its simplest form, a style of photography where one object is the primary focus, and everything else is strategically blurred.

Using the Bokeh effect is an excellent way to separate the focal point of your photo from non-focal points. It not only serves the purpose of highlighting the focus of the image, but can also help when you’re looking to get rid of an unpleasant or unwanted background. The blurred background is meant to keep your focal point at the absolute center of your audience’s attention.

What’s more, Image Glitch Tool enables you to take photos with a webcam and apply glitch effect to them just moments after you captured them. The Amount, Seed, Iterations, and Quality sliders allow you to fine-tune the glitch effect so that it fits the image you are editing.
