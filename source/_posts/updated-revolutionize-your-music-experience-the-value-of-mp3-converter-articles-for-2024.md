04 [How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **6 Best Free MP3 Converter for Windows 10 / 11**

As promised, we start this off with the best **audio converter** (**Windows 10**/11) tools. We've decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE **MP3 Converters** (**Windows**), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter's interface looks like.

### 01**EaseUs MobiMover**

EaseUs MobiMover is an **audio converter for Windows 10** and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It's a FREEmium software though — which means that it's use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.

![EaseUs MobiMover - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%201.png)

### 02**Freemake Video Converter**

Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE **MP3 converter for Windows 10** on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It's a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)

![Freemake Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%202.png)

### 03**VSDC**

Much like Freemake, our next **MP3 converter for Windows 10** and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it's not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an **audio-video-converter for Windows 10** (and vice versa.)

![VSDC - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%203.png)

### 04**Convertio.co**

With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!

![Convertio - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%204.png)

### 05**Free Convert**

Free Convert is another online **MP3 convert for Windows 10** users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you'll have to pay for the premium version.

![Free Convert - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%205.png)

### 06**DVDVideoSoft**

With DVDVideoSoft, we're back to an **audio-video converter for Windows 10** that you have to download and install to work! It's a FREEmium software too. That means that you'll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.

![DVDVideoSoft](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%206.png)

## Part 2 **6 Best Free and Paid Audio Editor for PC and Mac**

For this next section, we turn our attention to a couple of **MP3 editors** (**Windows 10** and Mac compatible.) This list will be a little more detailed than the first, since there are many differences between the tools that we'll be introducing (both FREE and PAID), but it should give you a clear idea on which would work best for you.

### 01**Wondershare Filmora**

Operating System: Windows/Mac

Today's Best Deals: US$89.99 (one-time)

The first on our list is the **MP3 editor Windows 10** and Mac compatible, [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) This is an advanced video editing software that you can use in order to work on just about any digital project — including, of course, editing your MP3 audio files.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Lots of editing tools for MP3 files

**●** Exports high-quality end-products

### 02**Audacity**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Advanced video and audio editing tools

**●** MP3 trimming/cutting feature

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Not updated as often

**●** Confusing interface

**●** Difficult to use for beginners

![Audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%208.png)

### 03**Ashampoo Music Studio 8**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: US$29.99

Next up is Ashampoo's Music Studio 8! Here's another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it's the tool that you're looking for, but you'll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it's quite the effective **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** (among other things). So, if that's what you're looking for, then it's a good choice to consider.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Clean, modern interface

**●** Beginner-friendly editing tools

**●** One-time fee only

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Freemium software (one-time payment required)

**●** Available only for Windows!

**●** Cannot support multiple tracks

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%209.png)

### 04**Ocenaudio**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

As far as audio-editing goes, you're probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that's all you're looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Beginner-friendly audio editor

**●** Simple, clean interface

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older software

**●** Open-source, not updated as often

**●** Only an audio-editing software

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2010.png)

### 05**Acoustica**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Our next pick is another open-source, **MP3 editor for Windows 10**. It's called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it's a fairly advanced audio editing tool. You should note, however, that the newer versions of this product are PAID (only older models are free), which is the topic of our discussion today.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source product

**●** Advanced audio editing tools

**●** Advanced exporting formats

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older version of the software

**●** Updated version is PAID

**●** Available only for Windows

![Acoustica](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2011.png)

### 06**Audiotool**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it's certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn't mean that it won't work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux users

**●** Advanced audio editing

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Complex editing interface

**●** Requires internet to work (Linux)

**●** Not regularly updated

## Part 3 **5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC**

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

![Save Finished Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2022.png)

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

04 [How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **6 Best Free MP3 Converter for Windows 10 / 11**

As promised, we start this off with the best **audio converter** (**Windows 10**/11) tools. We've decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE **MP3 Converters** (**Windows**), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter's interface looks like.

### 01**EaseUs MobiMover**

EaseUs MobiMover is an **audio converter for Windows 10** and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It's a FREEmium software though — which means that it's use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.

![EaseUs MobiMover - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%201.png)

### 02**Freemake Video Converter**

Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE **MP3 converter for Windows 10** on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It's a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)

![Freemake Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%202.png)

### 03**VSDC**

Much like Freemake, our next **MP3 converter for Windows 10** and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it's not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an **audio-video-converter for Windows 10** (and vice versa.)

![VSDC - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%203.png)

### 04**Convertio.co**

With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!

![Convertio - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%204.png)

### 05**Free Convert**

Free Convert is another online **MP3 convert for Windows 10** users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you'll have to pay for the premium version.

![Free Convert - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%205.png)

### 06**DVDVideoSoft**

With DVDVideoSoft, we're back to an **audio-video converter for Windows 10** that you have to download and install to work! It's a FREEmium software too. That means that you'll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.

![DVDVideoSoft](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%206.png)

## Part 2 **6 Best Free and Paid Audio Editor for PC and Mac**

For this next section, we turn our attention to a couple of **MP3 editors** (**Windows 10** and Mac compatible.) This list will be a little more detailed than the first, since there are many differences between the tools that we'll be introducing (both FREE and PAID), but it should give you a clear idea on which would work best for you.

### 01**Wondershare Filmora**

Operating System: Windows/Mac

Today's Best Deals: US$89.99 (one-time)

The first on our list is the **MP3 editor Windows 10** and Mac compatible, [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) This is an advanced video editing software that you can use in order to work on just about any digital project — including, of course, editing your MP3 audio files.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Lots of editing tools for MP3 files

**●** Exports high-quality end-products

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Download and installation is required

![Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%207.png)

### 02**Audacity**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Advanced video and audio editing tools

**●** MP3 trimming/cutting feature

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Not updated as often

**●** Confusing interface

**●** Difficult to use for beginners

![Audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%208.png)

### 03**Ashampoo Music Studio 8**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: US$29.99

Next up is Ashampoo's Music Studio 8! Here's another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it's the tool that you're looking for, but you'll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it's quite the effective **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** (among other things). So, if that's what you're looking for, then it's a good choice to consider.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Clean, modern interface

**●** Beginner-friendly editing tools

**●** One-time fee only

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Freemium software (one-time payment required)

**●** Available only for Windows!

**●** Cannot support multiple tracks

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%209.png)

### 04**Ocenaudio**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

As far as audio-editing goes, you're probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that's all you're looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Beginner-friendly audio editor

**●** Simple, clean interface

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older software

**●** Open-source, not updated as often

**●** Only an audio-editing software

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2010.png)

### 05**Acoustica**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Our next pick is another open-source, **MP3 editor for Windows 10**. It's called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it's a fairly advanced audio editing tool. You should note, however, that the newer versions of this product are PAID (only older models are free), which is the topic of our discussion today.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source product

**●** Advanced audio editing tools

**●** Advanced exporting formats

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older version of the software

**●** Updated version is PAID

**●** Available only for Windows

![Acoustica](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2011.png)

### 06**Audiotool**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it's certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn't mean that it won't work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux users

**●** Advanced audio editing

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Complex editing interface

**●** Requires internet to work (Linux)

**●** Not regularly updated

### 02**Audacity**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Advanced video and audio editing tools

**●** MP3 trimming/cutting feature

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Not updated as often

**●** Confusing interface

**●** Difficult to use for beginners

So, if that's what you're looking for, then it's a good choice to consider.

**Reasons to Buy:**

## Part 3 **5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC**

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

![Save Finished Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2022.png)

A little over a decade later, whiteboard animations are used for a wide array of purposes that range from explainer to educational videos. We’ve combed the Internet to find the best whiteboard animation makers in 2020, so let’s dive in and see what these software products and web-based platforms have to offer.

## Top Five Hand Drawing Whiteboard Animation Makers in 2021

The so-called doodle videos are entertaining to watch because the viewer can see a hand drawing shapes or writing in front of their eyes. Creating this type of animated videos no longer requires years of training and hours of hard work, since there are countless options that enable marketers to produce whiteboard animations in just a few minutes. Here are some of the best whiteboard [animation makers online](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can find on the market in 2020.

#### 1. [Moovly](https://www.moovly.com/)

**Price:** Free trial available, subscription plans start at $24.92 per month billed annually

**Compatibility:** web-based

Moovly is much more than an online destination where you can create whiteboard animations effortlessly as it grants you access to more than a million royalty free images, videos, and sounds. The platform’s video editor lets you choose the gender of the hand that is drawing the animation or its skin color. In addition to simulating the hand drawing process of virtually any object you can think of, the Moovly’s editor also enables you to adjust the size of the elements you add to your story or incorporate handwritten text into the animation video you’re producing. The free version of the platform watermarks all videos you export and lacks any of the advanced features that are available if you opt for one of the education or subscription plans. Even so, Moovly is still one of the best web-based whiteboard animation makers you can find on the Internet because it lets you create new videos in just a few quick steps.

#### 2. [VideoScribe](https://www.videoscribe.co/en/)

**Price:** Free version available, subscription plans start at $25 per month for a single user

**Compatibility:** cloud-based or downloadable software for Mac and PC computers

In case you need cloud-based software you can use for free to create animations in a short period of time, then VideoScribe is probably one of the best choices you can make. The software features huge image, video and music libraries that are well-suited for a broad range of whiteboard animations, and it also offers a wide array of hands, pens, and erasers. In addition, you can import assets you’ve created and VideoScribe will animate them for you. The voiceover feature is particularly useful if you are looking to add narration to your explainer and educational videos or product reviews. VideoScribe can only be used offline if you purchase its Pro version and you won’t be able to export HD video files if you opt to create your whiteboard animations with the free version of this software. This whiteboard animation maker is an excellent option for businesses that want to improve their social media presence through the production of animated whiteboard explainer videos or educational institutions that are looking for a way to keep their students engaged.

You can make attention-grabbing whiteboard animations with Explaindio even if you have no previous experience as an animator. The software is equipped with more than 800 doodle sketches, hundreds of HD video backgrounds, 200 ready-made animated scenes, over 300 fonts, and countless full 3D animations. Explaindio also lets you import your own fonts, audio files or external 3D elements and it features a timeline with multiple videos and audio tracks. What’s more, the software has a rich library of transitions you can use to avoid hard cuts between the shots or to change scenes in your whiteboard animations smoothly. Besides whiteboard animations, you can use Explaindio to animate typography, create intros and outros for YouTube videos and to make logo strings. Cloud storage is also available so that you can access your creations while you’re on the go, which is one of the reasons why more than 35.000 YouTubers, marketers, and animators are already using Explaindio.

![explaindio-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/explaindio-interface.png)

#### 4. [Doodly](https://www.doodly.com/)

**Price:** Pricing plans start at $39 per month

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

Hiring professional animators to create your whiteboard animations for you is both expensive and time-consuming. Doodly solves both of these issues by enabling you to simply drag and drop animated elements to the timeline and produce visually attractive hand-drawn animations at a reasonable price. The software features an extensive collection of male and female hands whose skin color you can adjust with a single click. There are hundreds of pre-made sketches available, and you just have to add the one you like to the canvas and Doodly will automatically animate the drawing for you. You can also choose if you want to use a whiteboard, blackboard or glassboard surface as a background for your animation. The Doodly Smart Draw technology lets you import and animate any hand drawing so you don’t have to rely on the software’s built-in library of doodles. The best part is that you can export all animations you create with Doodly in Full HD resolution.

#### 5. [Vyond](https://www.vyond.com/)

**Price:** 14-day free trial available, subscription plans start at $299 per year for a single user

**Compatibility:** web-based

Formerly known as GoAnimate, Vyond has been one of the best cloud-based video animation platforms for more than a decade. Its Whiteboard Animation theme offers a huge selection of props, character actions and other animated elements that can be useful for videos that cover a broad spectrum of topics. Simply select an element you want to add to your video, fine-tune its size on the screen and it will be drawn automatically. Vyond also enables you to import assets you’ve created which grants you more creative freedom, as you don’t necessarily have to rely solely on the built-in whiteboard animation elements this platform offers. The only downside is that you can’t record voiceovers directly from Vyond, and you either have to use an online voice recording service or utilize a desktop-based software product that enables you to record the narration for your upcoming animated video.

You don’t have to be a skilled animator in order to create hand drawing whiteboard animations since each of the options we featured in this article requires a minimum amount of technical skill.

However, if you somehow think about making more than just whiteboard video, say normal video editing, why not try out [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)? With Filmora, you can make any type of video that you want, including whiteboard videos.
