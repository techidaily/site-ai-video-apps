Next, you have to click on the “Shared Computers” option and click the plus button. You can find it in the lower-left area.

To make the process effective, you have to repeat this simple process on all the computers you want to add to the render farm within your network. Note: they need to have Compressor installed.

 Step 4:

This step entails that you rename titles set as “Untitled” or something relatable or easy to remember.

 Step 5:

Next, you can click on that group to view all your computers within your network with sharing enabled. Furthermore, you can also check for more computers that you may want to add.

 Step 6:

When you add a file to be transcoded, look for the “Process On” button, you can find it on the lower right. Select the drop-down option to view your complete group.

 Step 7:

To begin, you can select your present group. Next, click the “Start Batch” option. This should begin the process.

 Note: if you have the FCPX 10.1.3 and Compressor 4.1 version installed, the above-explained feature will not be enabled within FCPX utilizing the Send to Compressor feature. If you go ahead with its anyway, your group will be greyed, therefore preventing it from being selected.
