The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

We’ve picked out some of the best **audio converters** available right now based on several different factors

You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert Audio?](#Part 1)

02 [How we tested the best audio converter software?](#Part 2)

03 [Essential Features of Audio Converter Software](#Part 3)

04 [What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

****Step 4: Start Conversion!**

Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting 'CONVERT’.

![Start conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%204.png)

****Step 5: Download or Save File!**

Once the conversion has been completed, your **audio converter** will either give you an option to 'DOWNLOAD’ or 'SAVE’ the finished product to your device!

![Download or Save Converted Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%205.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…

02 [How we tested the best audio converter software?](#Part 2)

03 [Essential Features of Audio Converter Software](#Part 3)

04 [What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

****Step 4: Start Conversion!**

Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting 'CONVERT’.

![Start conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%204.png)

****Step 5: Download or Save File!**

Once the conversion has been completed, your **audio converter** will either give you an option to 'DOWNLOAD’ or 'SAVE’ the finished product to your device!

![Download or Save Converted Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%205.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…

## Where to Find Free Images for Commercial Projects

Did you know that some of the world's most iconic advertisements use stock images for commercial use? For example, AlamapBBDO, a Brazilian ad agency, used stock photos from Getty Images to create their [Endless Possibilities campaign](https://thinkmarketingmagazine.com/getty-images-brilliant-campaign-re-create-4-famous-faces-out-of-random-stock-photos/) in 2016\. The advertising campaign combined photos of random people's faces to recreate portraits of famous people such as the Dalai Lama and Pope Francis.

![images for commercial use](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-1.jpg)

Most creative agencies prefer altering stock images in most of their work. This is because it allows them to create campaigns for different companies much faster at affordable costs. Keep reading to find out how to get free images for commercial use in your next project.

## Part 1: Download images in loyalty-free sites

Several sites offer free images for commercial use as part of their services. In addition, you do not need to register an account to download the images. The sites typically rely on user contributions and content teams to ensure their databases are fresh and maintain consistent quality. Furthermore, all creative assets they offer fall under the creative commons zero license or a variation of it. Here are some of the sites that offer you images for commercial use for free.

### 1\. Pexels

![pexels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-2.jpg)

Pexels.com is a free-to-use provider of high-resolution photos and videos for aspiring creators. The German-based website was started in 2014 by two brothers and has been under the Canva umbrella since 2018.

Currently, the website hosts over 3.2 million images and videos from over 250,000 active contributors. In addition, all the material you find in its library is under the Pexels license, which slightly varies from the creative commons zero license model. Some of the restrictions it enforces include:

* You can only use pexels images for commercial use after making alterations to the original image. For example, you can use part of an image to create a collage for your commercial branding.
* Furthermore, you cannot use any of the website's content to promote political ideologies and explicit content, especially if the images contain identifiable subjects.

Pexels is available through the following channels:

* Your web browser by typing the URL pexels.com.
* The Android and iOS app.
* A plugin for other content creation software such as Google Slides and MS Office.
* An extension on your Chrome browser.
* You can also access the database using the official Canva app.

### 2\. Unsplash

![unsplash](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-3.jpg)

Another website that offers free images for commercial use is Unsplash, a subsidiary of Getty Images since 2021\. The website is a favorite among creators boasting over 16 billion photo impressions monthly. In addition, the database consists of over 3.48 million photos from more than 265,000 unique contributors, all under the Unsplash license.

The Unsplash license restricts the sale of its creative assets without incorporating new creative elements, including using them in print media and physical goods such as mugs and caps.

You can access Unsplash from your web browser or request API integration for your application from the site's owners. In addition, the site also hosts photo walks across different cities, where Unsplash guides show you the best photo locations around the city and the best camera techniques for your work. Some cities to host the event include Boston, Montreal, Tokyo, and Toronto.

### 3\. Freerange

![freerange](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-4.jpg)

Freerange Stock is an online resource for photos, illustrations, and textures you can download and use for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Since 2007, the site has continued to provide high-quality images to its community of over 800,000 registered users.

Unlike the previous examples, all content on Freerange falls under the website's Equalicense. It grants you broad commercial rights of its stock images while allowing the contributors to retain control of their copyright, image resale, and distribution. As such, you cannot use the images for bulk distribution or print-on-demand works.

Freerange Stock maintains its steady supply of images for commercial use via the following methods:

* It has an in-house team of professional photographers who upload images across the different categories on the website.
* Freerange Stock also purchases image rights or directly commissions photos from independent creators.
* You can also contribute to the website's library by voluntarily submitting your work to the platform. Kindly note that you will need a verified account to enable this function.
* The website also works directly with photographers through a licensing and distribution model, providing them extra exposure on the site.
* Finally, Freerange stock aggregates public domain images from other sources, including similar sites and government institutions. It does so by acknowledging the image owner and sometimes lists the image source when the owner is unknown.

Freerange Stock is accessible through your web browser or as an API integration on your app.

### 4\. Vecteezy

![vecteezy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-5.jpg)

Vecteezy is an extensive online library of free stock images for commercial use. Some of the site's highlight features include the following:

* A best-in-class search engine that incorporates multiple filters to ensure your results are extremely accurate. For example, you can sort images by color, style, number of people, and age of the subjects, something other free stock websites do not provide.
* All images, videos, and vector illustrations are free for personal and commercial uses. It does so through a property sign and release model with its extensive network of contributors, which protects users from any legal liabilities.
* Finally, it employs a content team that manually reviews each photo submission to ensure consistent quality standards for its offerings.

In addition, you can also purchase design resource bundles by subscribing to its Vecteezy pro for as little as $9 monthly. Some of the resources available include the Ultimate Text Effects Layer Styles Bundle for Photoshop, which costs $39 stand-alone or $4.50 when you subscribe to pro.

## Part 2: Buy from stock providers

Another way to get images for commercial use is by buying them from stock providers. Some of the benefits of buying images from stock providers include:

* You get a wide selection of unique photos from top-tier photographers. Stock providers always seek collaborations with the industry's finest to edge out the competition.
* You receive exemplary customer service with your purchase. Selecting the right image can be confusing for amateur creators. As such, stock image providers have customer support channels to help you throughout your creative process.
* Stock images reduce your delivery times significantly. Buying images from a stock provider eliminates the need to invest in photography equipment and the time you need for post-production. As such, you can deliver projects in a fast and cost-effective way.

Despite the above positive, here are some challenges that buying stock images may present:

* Not all stock image providers will have the creative assets you need.
* Image overuse is likely since every creator will rush for the most popular contributor.

Below are some of the stock image providers you should consider.

### 1\. iStock

iStockphoto.com is an online database of creative resources, including royalty-free photos, videos, audio, illustrations, and clip art you can use in your creations. The website is a Getty Images subsidiary based in Calgary, Canada. In addition, contributors earn royalties depending on how often users download their content.

### 2\. Alamy.com

Alamy.com is a British-owned stock image provider with contributions from photographers and agencies in 173 countries. It compensates its contributors by offering higher than average payouts every time users download their creations. Some popular brands to use Alamy's services include M&C Saatchi, Microsoft, and The Economist.

## Part 3: Shot a Photo by yourself or create one with editing tools

Alternatively, you can get images for commercial use by shooting them yourself or creating them with editing tools such as Figma and Wondershare's Filmstock. Here are some benefits of using this method:

* You get exactly what you want, provided you have the required skills and equipment. Sometimes, getting the right image for your commercial purpose can be challenging. As such, shooting an original photo may be the only option.
* You have full ownership of the image.

Unlike obtaining images from stock photography websites, you are free to use the image in whatever capacity you please without any restrictions. For example, sites such as Unsplash do not allow you to use their images in political statements, a restriction you can bypass when using your own creations.

However, you should also consider the following factors when using this method.

### It requires a substantial investment

Getting high-quality images for commercial purposes requires specialist equipment. For example, the Panasonic LUMIX GH6 camera, which has 4K resolution capability, costs $2,197 on Amazon. This makes it extremely expensive for amateur creators.

### There is a steep learning curve

Becoming a professional photographer takes time and effort. Unless you are creating as a hobby, it will be a while before you can start generating income from your creations.

## Part 4: FAQs

### 1\. Do you need a contributor account to get images for commercial use?

Not necessarily. Stock image sites like pexels.com allow you to download images from their website without creating an account. You will only need one if you want to showcase your work on the platform.

### 2\. Can you use your smartphone to get images for commercial use?

Yes. Most stock image providers have device-specific apps that allow you to access their databases from your mobile device. For example, UnsplashPhotoPicker allows you access to the Unsplash library from your Android device.

Such as Prime Video playing in Smart TV, Phone of Mi TV not appearing widescreen to have a better view or sometimes outline bars appear that makes the visible area quite less. What to do to solve the issue or if there exists some solution? Let's take a look over some of the reasons due to which Amazon Prime Video widescreen does not appear as required:

**●** Some of the devices do not support particular resolution videos.

**●** In some devices under the settings, there comes an app scaling option to make Amazon Prime Video widescreen. However, this is not the official way to do so, though it works many times. But, this option varies from system to system.

**●** This often occurs when the dimension of the device screen mismatch with that of the video aspect ratio. Since a 16:9 aspect ratio or 1920X1080 pixel resolution is required for a Full HD video, device dimension varies, say 2400X1080 pixels. Now, if you want to see your video in a 1:1 ratio, then around 240 pixel wide black bars will appear on either side of the video if kept in landscape mode.

Alternatively, if you try to zoom in on the video, black bars will disappear, resulting in cropping the video visuals from the side.
