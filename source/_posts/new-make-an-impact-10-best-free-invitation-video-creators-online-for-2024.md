Developed by Lightricks Studio, Videoleap is one of the most powerful video editors, which is available for iOS and Android devices. While you can directly install Videoleap on your iPhone or Android phone by visiting its App/Play Store page, you won’t find its desktop application. That’s why a lot of people find it hard to install Videoleap on their macOS systems. Don’t worry – here, I will let you know how to install **Videoleap for MacBook** and would also list its best alternatives.

## Part 2: Download and Install Videoleap for MacBook

As I have listed above, **Videoleap for MacBook** is not directly available as it runs on iOS and Android devices only. Though, you can access this video editor on your Mac by using any reliable Android emulator tool. An emulator can load an Android OS environment on your Windows or Mac system, letting you run all these smartphone apps.

While there are plenty of Android emulators out there, these are some of the most popular options:

* BlueStacks
* Nox Player
* MEmu Player
* ARChon Player

Out of them, let’s consider the example of BlueStacks as it is the most popular and reliable Android emulator in the market. You can install BlueStacks on your MacBook for free, log in to your Google account, and can readily use Videoleap on it.

**Step 1: Install a Reliable Android Emulator like BlueStacks**

To begin with, you can install any reliable Android emulator on your MacBook. For instance, if you want to install BlueStacks, then you can visit its official website, and click on the “Download” button.

## Part 3: 2 Best Alternatives to Videoleap for MacBook

As you can see, installing **Videoleap for a MacBook** can be a tedious job as it is only available for smartphones. Therefore, instead of using an emulator to install Videoleap, you can consider using the following video editors on your Mac.

### 2\. iMovie

Lastly, if you are looking for a freely available alternative for **Videoleap for MacBook**, then you can try iMovie.

## Final Words

There you go! I’m sure that after following this guide, you can easily use **Videoleap for MacBook.** Since Videoleap is only available for iOS and Android devices, I have come up with a stepwise approach to install it on Mac. Though, instead of Videoleap, you can consider using Wondershare Filmora on your MacBook. It is a far better and more user-friendly video editor for Mac that has some of the most advanced features.

Irrespective of the kind of device you’re using to edit your videos, you need to pay attention to some features your device must have. However, these requirements depend on the 4K video editing software free.

* **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** The Processor of the software being used must be Intel Core i7, 2.3Ghz four-core; this is applicable if you will be editing your videos offline. Then, Dual Intel Xeon 2Ghz six-core is applicable if you will be editing your videos online.
* **Random Access Memory (RAM):** Preferably an 8GB Memory if you’re editing offline, and 32GB Memory if you’re editing online.
* **Internal storage:** The required storage must be sufficient because 4K videos are huge files.

Note: Offline editing refers to editing a [proxy file of the original source material](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/); online editing is the editing of the original material.

## Part 3: Tips for Editing 4K Videos Smoothly

* **Choose the software based on your hardware:** To choose the best 4K video editing software free, you must not opt for an editing software with higher requirements than your hardware; such software won’t work well on your device. You should instead select an editing software with lower requirements.
* [**Split large 4K videos into several parts**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/): It has been reiterated that 4K videos are huge files; to edit your videos smoothly, it is recommended to split up the videos and edit one after the other. This will save you from heavy data loss.
* **Enable graphics accelerator**: A graphic accelerator is used in video editing to turbocharge your video exporting. It’s usually clung to a video board of your system. It makes the editing easier and faster by preventing a heavy workload.
