When you are editing your videos with Adobe Premiere, you can use some useful Adobe Premiere tips to help you run the program faster and do the video editing more efficiently. Here the most useful 10 tips for using [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Adobe Premiere Elements](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are provided for your reference.

---

 This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 Use the following Adobe Premiere tips to make your video editing easier and save time and energy. Make the process much easier than you had thought.

## Useful Adobe Premiere Pro and Elements tips

#### 1. Change the default settings

 You can save some time on video editing by changing two default settings: Scale Media to Project Size and Default Picture Length. You can go to Edit > Preferences > General to find the two settings. Scale Media to Project Size means any photo or video will be scaled down to the project size. This setting will save you a lot of time especially when you are mixing a lot of SD and HD video and photos. Default Picture Length originally is set at 150 frames or five seconds of footage. You can change it to any set mount so that you don't need to adjust every photo you import. When you finished the settings changing, hit "OK" to save.

#### 2.Capture video clips from your camcorder directly

 Remember that you don't need to transfer your camcorder videos to your hard drive first and then import the video clips to Adobe Premiere. When you have connected your camcorder or other video capture devices to your computer, set the camcorder to playback or set it in VCR mode. Then, in Adobe Premiere, start a new project and go to File > Capture to import your media from your camcorder directly. This will save your some time for Adobe Premiere video editing.

#### 3. Keep your project more organized with "Bins"

 You can click the "Folder" icon in the "Project" window to create a new folder to store video clips or other things. Store them in many different folders rather than only one so that you can find what you want more quickly. Create bins for storing separate audio, video, photo, etc. This Adobe Premiere tip will definitely makes your project more organized and can save time for editing.

#### 4. Create personalized video transitions

 When adding transition effects to videos, you can make some adjustments to the transition effects to make them more personalized. You can locate the transition effects in the "Effects" tab. And in the "Effect Controls" tab, you adjust the transitions such as changing the duration time, changing the entrance animation, etc.

#### 5. Choose the most suitable output video format

 Take the output video quality to consideration when creating a new project in Adobe Premier. For example, if you just want to share the videos on YouTube, then you don't need to create HD videos because it will take you much more time to upload the videos to Internet if they're HD videos. Besides, the HD videos also need much more storage space. Get the smaller video size with better compression and easily share your videos on Web.

#### 6. Quick render

 In Adobe Premiere, most effects and videos render in real time. To have a full preview of all the effects, you can press "Enter", which will render the project and enables you to preview the overall video effect in the "Monitor" window.

 Tip: Adobe Premiere is a very professional video editor and costs a lot. For a video editing beginner, it's better turn to some easy-to-use yet powerful video editor, say [Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which can help you burn to DVD directly and share to YouTube in several click. If you don't want to spend any money on video editing, you can also turn to some free video editing software like Windows Movie Maker or iMovie.

## Cloud Stop Motion Creation: Tips, Tricks, and Top Software Picks

Creating a stop motion video is a fascinating process. If you use the right software and know the basics of making videos, you can create fantastic animations. While creating a stop motion video, there are things to keep in mind, like keeping the cameras steady and using the proper audio effects. Cloud Stop motion is well-known software with the tools to create unique video projects on your smartphone, laptop, desktop, Chromebook, or even tablet.

## Part 1\. Introduction- Cloud Stop Motion

It is easy to create stop motion animation with this web-based app. To use cloud stop motion you must first create an account and grant the app permission to your computer's webcam. Then you can start a new project and start taking pictures.

Each image is displayed on the timeline to know all photos that are going to be included in the stop motion video. On Cloud Stop Motion, you have the option to either record or import audio files from the sound library or your device. You can add additional things, like opening titles, end credits, speech bubbles, and text overlays. It functions directly in the browser on any modern device.

You do not have to install anything. It is all saved to the cloud. You can work with your animation on a zoomable, scrollable timeline.

Features -

* Easy to use, powerful, and intuitive software to create animations.
* The Interface has a modern design.
* It is equipped with a rich audio library, backgrounds and styles included.
* You can switch devices seamlessly at any point.

## Part 2\. How to Use Cloud Stop Motion to Create Animation Videos?

Cloud Stop Motion is a great browser-based app that one can use to create fun animation videos. You can use Cloud Stop Motion even when you have not created your account. But consider creating an account to enjoy additional features.

![cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Before you open Cloud Stop Motion and start clicking pictures of your subject for your video, it is important to have a story in mind. So, create a storyboard to break down your stop motion video. You can sketch your plan frame by frame or write bulleted list of your frames. It will help you create your project efficiently, ensuring that you have taken pictures of all the frames that you need to tell your story.

![adding new project on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-project-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Step 1: Once you have created your storyboard, open the app to go to the Cloud Stop Motion dashboard. Click on the new project button. Cloud Stop Motion needs access to your camera for capturing images. So, allow camera access.

![allowing access to camera on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/allowing-access-to-camera-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

On the dashboard, go to the taking picture menu. Now place the subject at the center of your frame. Capture a few test shots to find the composition that you like. You can see the picture at the bottom of the timeline. If needed, adjust the position of your subject. Make sure that the location you choose has plenty of light. If not, you also use a lamp for good light.

Tip: Keeping your phone or camera steady while making your stop-motion project is the key. You can use a tripod, a selfie stick, or a gimbal to keep your device as still as possible. If you don't own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.

Step 2: Move your subject or change its position and take a picture. Repeat the process until you complete your story. To make your stop-motion smooth, make small changes to the position of your subject between shots.

![capturing images on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/capturing-images-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

You can also add more frames per second. Generally, you should add 10 frames per second. But you can go for 25 frames per second to make a smoother video. All the pictures you snap are automatically added to the editor in chronological order.

Step 3: Once you have captured images for your project, add sound by going to the sound menu in the top left of the dashboard. You can record sounds, upload sounds, or select sounds from Cloud Stop Motion's gallery. You can also add text to your Cloud Stop Motion project if you want.

Step 4: Click on play button to preview your project and see if your motion picture turned out as per your liking or not. If you do not like something, go back and make changes. Once done, download your video from cloudstop motion.

Part 2\. How to Use Cloud Stop Motion to Create Animation Videos?

Cloud Stop Motion is a great browser-based app that one can use to create fun animation videos. You can use Cloud Stop Motion even when you have not created your account. But consider creating an account to enjoy additional features.

![cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Before you open Cloud Stop Motion and start clicking pictures of your subject for your video, it is important to have a story in mind. So, create a storyboard to break down your stop motion video. You can sketch your plan frame by frame or write bulleted list of your frames. It will help you create your project efficiently, ensuring that you have taken pictures of all the frames that you need to tell your story.

![adding new project on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-project-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Step 1: Once you have created your storyboard, open the app to go to the Cloud Stop Motion dashboard. Click on the new project button. Cloud Stop Motion needs access to your camera for capturing images. So, allow camera access.

If you don't own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.

## Audio Perfection: A Step-by-Step Guide to Selecting the Ideal FLAC Converter

##### Ways to Totally Help Your Find Best Flac Converter

An easy yet powerful editor

Numerous effects to choose from

Detailed tutorials provided by the official channel

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

We have eight recommendations for you below that will allow you to pretty much do whatever you want (i.e., **convert FLAC to MP3**, convert **FLAC to ALAC**, **convert WAV to FLAC**, MP4 to FLAC, FLAC to MP4, M4A to FLAC, WAV to FLAC, and so much more.)

We've even included a handy general tutorial just after this to make sure that you're able to easily make use of your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)](#Part 1)

02 [8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)**

As promised, we'll be starting this off with a general tutorial that you can refer to when using the converters that we've listed below! The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

Here's a link to FreeConvert in case you wanted to try it out for yourself:

![Upload FLAC Audio File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%201.png)

### 02**Step 2: Confirm Output Format!**

For our example, we'll be converting from **FLAC to MP3**. And so, when prompted to choose the desired output format, we choose "MP3"!

(Most converters will have multiple audio file formats and video file formats that you can convert to if you want to do something completely different — as is shown below):

![Confirm MP3 as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%202.png)

### 03**Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Settings**

Before finishing up, you might want to explore the extra advanced settings offered by your chosen **FLAC Converter**! Each one will have different features.

FreeConvert, as an example, will allow you to adjust volume, add fade-in, add fade-out, reverse audio, and, even, trim audio before conversion! All you have to do to access these functions is to click the "SETTINGS" icon (pointed out in the image).

![Advance Settings Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%203.png)

### 04**Step 4: Convert FLAC to MP3**

To initiate the actual conversion with FreeConvert, all you really need to do is click the 'Convert to MP3' button. Other **FLAC converter**s, while not the same, should be similar.

![Select Convert to MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%204.png)

### 05**Step 5: Download Converted FLAC Audio!**

Finally, when the conversion has been completed, select the 'Download MP3' button to save your converted audio to your PC! That's it, you're done!

![Select Download MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%205.png)

## Part 2 **8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter**

Now on to our list of the best **free FLAC Converter** options out there. We have eight of them for you to choose from, each unique from the other to make sure that you can find the one that suits your current need or project the most.

### 01****[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

**Compatibility**: Windows & Mac OS

**What's New**: More Video Editing Solutions!

**Rating and Reviews**: 5/5

**Price**: FREEmium

Filmora is the first software on this list of **FLAC converter** options. As you'll no doubt glean from the screenshot of the UI that we included, this isn't really your average **FLAC converter**. But that's why we included it! With Filmora Pro, not only will you get the FLAC converting functions that you're looking for, but you'll also get many other features.

### 02**UniConverter**

**Compatibility**: Windows & Mac OS

**What's New**: Extra Toolbox!

**Rating and Reviews**: 5/5

**Price**: FREEmium

For this next pick, just to cover our bases, we've chosen Wondershare Uniconverter. As you can guess from the name (and the UI, which we've shared below), this is an incredibly advanced converting tool. In order to match the requirements for this article, it does, of course, support FLAC as both input and output for conversion. But, even more than that, it offers bonus features (i.e., Download, Video Compressor, Video Editor, Content Merger, Screen Converter, etc.)

![Wondershare UniConverter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%207.png)

### 03**XConvert**

**Compatibility**: Windows & Mac OS + Android & iOS Support

**What's New**: Google Drive & Dropbox Upload!

**Rating and Reviews**: 3/5

**Price**: FREE

With XConvert, we offer a secondary option for those who are looking for a **FLAC converter online**. This tool, much like FreeConvert, does not require any download or installation process. You can use it directly on your computer, smartphone, or tablet devices. Of course, unlike Filmora Pro or Wondershare UniConverter, it does not have extra bonus functions. But, it is, at the very least, 100% FREE.

![XConvert FLAC to MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%208.png)

### 04**FLAC MP3 Converter**

**Compatibility**: Mac OS & iOS Support

**What's New**: High Quality FLAC to MP3 Conversion

**Rating and Reviews**: 3.5/5

**Price**: FREEmium

If you're a Mac user and are looking for a quick, FREE solution for **FLAC to MP3** conversion, you might want to consider the FLAC MP3 converter, which is available on the app store! This app is not 100% FREE, but you do have the opportunity to use it for general conversion if that's all you need.

![FLAC MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%209.png)

### 05**123Apps**

**Compatibility**: Windows and Mac & iOS and Android Support!

**What's New**: Track Info Editing Tools!

**Rating and Reviews**: 3.5/5

**Price**: FREE

Up next is another online **FLAC converter** that you can use! One that will allow you to make sure that there is no quality loss! This tool is simply called Audio Converter, and it comes from 123Apps. It works just like any online audio converter — which means that it is FREE and can be accessed on most devices.

![123Apps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%2010.png)

### 06**Audacity**

**Compatibility**: Windows OS

**What's New**: Advanced Audio Editing Functions!

**Rating and Reviews**: 4/5

**Price**: FREE

When one talks about FREE audio editors, the one most frequently discussed is often Audacity! As you can see, the UI for it is pretty old, but it comes with tons of advanced features. Of course, the one that you're probably most concerned about is its converting functions! For that, we can confirm that Audacity will, in fact, allow you to convert from FLAC or convert to FLAC. The process will be different, but it's possible!

![Audio Software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%2011.png)

### 07**MediaHuman Audio Converter**

**Compatibility**: Windows & Mac OS

**What's New**: Audio Editing Functions

**Rating and Reviews**: 4/5

**Price**: FREE

When it comes to Mac-prevalent audio converters, MediaHuman is often discussed as well! It is available for Windows, but its interface is best for its Mac version. As you can see from the UI screenshot, it's very clean and easy to use. Allowing you to get your conversions done with no fuss!

![MediaHuman](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%2012.png)

### 08**Freemake Audio Converter**

**Compatibility**: Windows OS

**What's New**: Advanced Audio Conversion (1000+ file support)

**Rating and Reviews**: 3.5/5

**Price**: FREE

The last of the tools on this list, Freemake, is another Windows-only software! Freemake allows you to convert to and from FLAC and offers some bonus editing features (though, notably, not as much as Wondershare's UniConverter, which locks some of its more advanced features for its premium version.)

![Freemake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%2013.png)

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

(Most converters will have multiple audio file formats and video file formats that you can convert to if you want to do something completely different — as is shown below):

![Confirm MP3 as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%202.png)

### 03**Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Settings**

Before finishing up, you might want to explore the extra advanced settings offered by your chosen **FLAC Converter**! Each one will have different features.

FreeConvert, as an example, will allow you to adjust volume, add fade-in, add fade-out, reverse audio, and, even, trim audio before conversion! All you have to do to access these functions is to click the "SETTINGS" icon (pointed out in the image).

### 04**Step 4: Convert FLAC to MP3**

To initiate the actual conversion with FreeConvert, all you really need to do is click the 'Convert to MP3' button. Other **FLAC converter**s, while not the same, should be similar.

### 05**Step 5: Download Converted FLAC Audio!**

Finally, when the conversion has been completed, select the 'Download MP3' button to save your converted audio to your PC! That's it, you're done!

02 [8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)**

As promised, we'll be starting this off with a general tutorial that you can refer to when using the converters that we've listed below! The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

Here's a link to FreeConvert in case you wanted to try it out for yourself:

### 08**Freemake Audio Converter**

**Rating and Reviews**: 3.5/5

**Price**: FREE

The last of the tools on this list, Freemake, is another Windows-only software!
