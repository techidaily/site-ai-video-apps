Premiere Pro CC enables you to turn the raw footage captured by any camera in any format into awe-inspiring videos. Besides offering superb video editing options that include powerful color correction tools and amazing effects, the software also offers a decent amount of audio editing options.

The only downside is that Premiere Pro CC is not best suited for inexperienced video editors, and it takes quite some time to master all of its features.

#### **_6._** **_Vegas Pro_**

**Price:**$399.00

**Compatibility:** Windows

Although Vegas Pro has never been as popular as Premier Pro, the video editing options, Vega Pro offers are no less powerful than those provided by Adobe's famed video enhancer.

The latest version of Vegas Pro also features Picture-in-Picture and Crop OFX plug-ins that let you overlay or experiment with several images in a single frame.

#### **_7._** **_Lightworks_**

This video editing software lets you do virtually anything if you know how to do it. Multicam editing, a rich selection of effects, or support for a wide array of video file formats make Lightworks an excellent choice for skilled video editing professionals.

#### **_8._** **_Final Cut Pro X_**

**Price:** $249.99

**Compatibility:** macOS

The possibilities Final Cut Pro offers are nearly endless.

Besides providing support for 360-degree videos, Final Cut Pro also offers 360-degree graphics and effects.

The video editor is built on a 64-bit, enabling users to work on highly demanding projects. However, it is best to check the system requirements before installing it on your Mac computer. Final Cut Pro is unsuitable for beginners in video editing because using most of its features requires an enviable amount of skill.

#### **_Conclusion_**
