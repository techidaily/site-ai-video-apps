## Part 2: Top 3 VSDC Video Editor for Mac Alternatives

After reviewing hundreds of freeware software, we have come up with the three best VSDC alternatives.

### 1\. ShotCut

A simple, free, and open-source software that makes the video-making process straightforward. Filled with interesting ideas and powerful features, the greatest thing about ShotCut is that besides being free — it is regularly updated and maintained by the vendor. The interface has a three-panel view and adding media files is as simple as dragging and dropping.

The software also includes rich features like keyframing, color correction, transition and lets you edit up to 4K resolution video with ease. But unlike VSDC, ShotCut does not have multiple preset transition effects and includes only 24 basic wipe-in or out effects. Still, the software has sophisticated features like Chroma Key and allows you to utilize third-party addons for text and titles as the application does not have many of them.

![shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsdc-for-mac-1.png)

**Pros:**

* Lightweight for a sophisticated video-editor
* The interface is simple and convenient and allows you to customize the toggles as per your preference
* Numerous output options — supports major formats and offers you to export the footage in any format
* Completely free platforms plus cross-platform support

**Cons:**

* The app does not allow you to create layers automatically.
* It could be tough for a newbie to work on ShotCut.
* The application takes too long to show the applied effects; even simple transition effects suffer from latency.

### 2\. OpenShot

Another free and open-source program, OpenShot, has the ability to give you high-quality output with minimal effort. The software includes all the basic functions like resizing, scaling, trimming, and audio mixing with real-time previews. Plus, it also incorporates features for animated-based keyframing and creating 2D animation with image sequencing.

Moreover, like the VSDC, there are also presets to give 3D effects like snowfall, text, and lens flares, and other effects to the video. Nonetheless, if you want to take these into your hand and need more flexibility over transition, effects, filters, and more then you will have to look elsewhere. Because although great, OpenShot does have gaps and excludes critical features, meaning if you want to give artistic effects and personalize the video as much as possible, OpenShot is not suitable for you.

![openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsdc-for-mac-2.jpg)

**Cons:**

* Many users have criticized the OpenShot video editor for lagging and crashing issues while editing high-resolution videos
* Even after multiple requests from the users, OpenShot does not support GPU acceleration for encoding and decoding the video files.
* Some critical features are missing.

### 3\. Avidemux

Like VSDC, Avidemux is also a freeware that includes all the basic options to edit the video and is much suitable for beginner-level users. However, if you are intermediate or expert in video editing, Avidemux is not the one you need. The reason: Avidemux does have basic options like cutting, trimming, splitting, and more. Still, when it comes to sophisticated features like creative effects, transition, Avidemux does not have dedicated functions for that. Moreover, as usual for the video editors, the Timeline feature is also missing from the software.

Of course, in comparison to VSDC, Avidemux falls short. Because all it can do is the basic video editing, encoding, and de-noising. Other than that, it cannot boast about anything. Still, given the simple interface, Avidemux is perfect for newbies who do not have much experience with video editing. Be that as it may, if you are serious regarding video-editing, you should get a more powerful video editor on Mac.

![avidemux](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/avidemux-for-mac-1.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Many users have criticized the OpenShot video editor for lagging and crashing issues while editing high-resolution videos
* Even after multiple requests from the users, OpenShot does not support GPU acceleration for encoding and decoding the video files.
* Some critical features are missing.

### 3\. Avidemux

Like VSDC, Avidemux is also a freeware that includes all the basic options to edit the video and is much suitable for beginner-level users. However, if you are intermediate or expert in video editing, Avidemux is not the one you need. The reason: Avidemux does have basic options like cutting, trimming, splitting, and more. Still, when it comes to sophisticated features like creative effects, transition, Avidemux does not have dedicated functions for that. Moreover, as usual for the video editors, the Timeline feature is also missing from the software.

Of course, in comparison to VSDC, Avidemux falls short. Because all it can do is the basic video editing, encoding, and de-noising. Other than that, it cannot boast about anything. Still, given the simple interface, Avidemux is perfect for newbies who do not have much experience with video editing. Be that as it may, if you are serious regarding video-editing, you should get a more powerful video editor on Mac.

![avidemux](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/avidemux-for-mac-1.jpg)

**Pros:**

* The simple interface allows even the naivest users to use the application to the fullest
* The application has all the basic video-editing features like cutting, splitting, trimming
* Avidemux is excellent for encoding options; one of the industry’s finest, in fact.
* Sharpening and de-noising filters to give fine details to the video

**Cons:**

* Avidemux does not have advanced video-editing options like effects and transition
* Lack the much important timeline feature

## Part 3: Final Words

VSDC is a powerful and unique tool. The above-listed freeware like ShotCut, OpenShot, and Avidemux are good alternatives to it. But after reviewing several video editors — this is the closest we came to finding something similar to VSDC. And understanding that Mac users will need all the powerful functions that VSDC incorporates, Filmora for Mac that includes everything that VSDC has and more! The Filmora for Mac is also free to utilize, so you can simply download the software and edit videos like professionals.

## Merge Videos Without a Trace: 7 Best Options

Sometimes, when delving into the vast space of internet and trying to find the perfect online platforms or software in order to edit some videos, it might get frustrating to find only the ones with watermark. But of course, the resources are endless and in case we have some information, we can easily access the free video editing platforms which give us the opportunity to edit our videos without undesired logos on them. In this case, we will be discussing 6 video mergers without watermark, and the way we can use them – the tools and features they offer, and how we can get the best out of them.

* **Photos by Microsoft**

If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.

### How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?

* **Fastreel by Movavi**

So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop/add multiple files right away.

The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.
