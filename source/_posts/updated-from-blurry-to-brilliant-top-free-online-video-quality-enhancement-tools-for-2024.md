## Final Cut Pro X Subtitle Editing: Tips and Tricks

# How to Add Subtitles/Captions in Final Cut Pro X?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

 Oct 26, 2023â€¢ Proven solutions

Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.

* **CEA-608 (SCC)**

It is a standard caption format for web videos and broadcasts.

* **SRT (SubRip)**

It is a simple and popular format used in online videos.

### Steps to Add Subtitles or Captions in FCPX

**Step 1: Create Caption Roles**

You need first to create caption roles to start adding captions to the timeline. Go to **Modify** \> **Edit Roles** and then select **Captions**. Then, select CEA-608, choose your language, and hit the Apply button.

**Step 2: Add Captions**

Position the playhead to where you have to set the Caption in the timeline. You need to hit the **Edit** tab and then select **Captions** \> **Add Caption**.

### 12\. [VideoScribe](https://www.videoscribe.co/en): Best 2D whiteboard Animation Software for Kids

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $28,00

This web-based platform enables anyone to create whiteboard animations that can be used in both professional and academic contexts. In fact, anyone can create a compelling white animation with VideoScribe in just three simple steps.

After selecting the images from the platformâ€™s library or uploading your own material and adding text, voiceovers, and music, VideoScribe will generate a whiteboard animation for you. This online platform offers an easy way to introduce your children to the world of animation and enables them to create animations from the images they create. Each whiteboard animation your child makes with VideoScribe can be shared to YouTube or Vimeo, but you should keep in mind that all animations created with the free version of this app are going to be watermarked.

**Pros**

* The image library contains more than 6000 royalty-free images
* VideoScribe lets its users record voiceovers
* Equipped with a broad range of hand, pens and other pre-animated elements
* Excellent file-sharing capabilities

**Cons**

* VideoScribe doesnâ€™t offer any video editing tools
* Removing watermark requires you to update to the pro version of the app

**Conclusion**

Encouraging your children to express their creativity can be beneficial for a variety of reasons. A video editing software like Filmora is one of your best choices if your child wants to create YouTube videos, while iOS and Android-based apps like Filmora or The Lego Movie 2 Movie Maker are well-suited for all children who would like to create videos from their Smartphones. Which of the best video editing apps for kids are you going to get for your child? Leave a comment and let us know.
