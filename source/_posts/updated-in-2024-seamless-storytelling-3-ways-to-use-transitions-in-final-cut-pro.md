If you make use of [Final Cut Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for video editing then it becomes much easier to adjust these transitions so that edited films can run smoothly. The information below will help you to get complete knowledge about managing transitions in videos using FCP.

* [Part 1: Using Shortcut to Apply Transitions >>](#part1)
* [Part 2: Use Browser to Apply Transition >>](#part2)
* [Part 3: Use Menu Bar to Apply Transition >>](#part3)

#### **Part 1: Using Shortcut to Apply Transitions:**

![Create transitions in FCP](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-in-fcp-1.png)

It is possible to apply transitions with a simple shortcut; all that you need to do is either blade your video clip into several scenes as per need or add two or more different scenes to be joined to your software timeline.

It is desired because the transition effect can be applied only if you have more than one clip on the timeline. Also, you can see more [keyboard shortcuts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) here.

![Blade your clip ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-in-fcp-2.png)

Once you have obtained your two scenes for which you need to add transition effect then select the very first scene from the timeline. Now open the Video animation window on your device, it can be done by pressing Shift+V; find the Compositing option, and then apply default transitions by simply dragging timeline handle towards both sides of the composite window. In FCP, Cross dissolve will be selected as the default transition.

#### **Part 2: Use Browser to Apply Transition:**

* Go to the media toolbar and then hit the transition icon. It can be identified as a shaded box over which X is written.

**In order to change the duration of transition:**

* Simply right-click on the timeline and select the Change duration option.
