### 5. VideoReverser

If you‚Äôve ever been remotely interested in a reverse video online editor, then chances are you‚Äôve already heard of [VideoReverser](https://www.videoreverser.com/).

You can set the output to any one of the popular formats like mpg, mov, mwv and mp4.

Much like the other online video reverser tools featured in this article, VideoReverser also works along the same premise: upload a file from a location on your computer/mobile device or paste the video URL. Select your output format, choose whether you want to mute the audio, and that‚Äôs it.

Choose from four different output formats, mpg, mov, mp4 and wmv, and click the Start button to view your video backwards.

**Pros**

* It‚Äôs super-free ‚Äì as in, free forever!
* Option to remove the audio track entirely

**Cons**

* Files larger than 10MB cannot be uploaded
* However, sometimes, if you upload a video around even 3-4MB, it will give an ‚Äúunexpected error‚Äù

### 6. Rocketium

Rocketium is another free online reverse video maker for reversing GIF or video files. Once the reverse file has been generated, you can download it to your desired location or share it across your social media channels.

Open [Rocketium](https://rocketium.com/is/video-reversing-tool/) in your browser, choose the ‚Äòupload a file‚Äô option or drag/drop media in the box under this option. Choose ‚Äòdownload‚Äô to save the reversed media file and you‚Äôre all done.

**Pros**

* Massive support for different file types ‚Äì 22 to be exact!
* Save the reversed video either on your device or share it directly on your social media accounts

**Cons**

* Exported files will have the Rocketium watermark
* Some users have complained about the mobile version not being as robust as the desktop one

### 7. Movie Maker Online

Another fantastic and free reverse video online creator which requires no registration whatsoever. Furthermore, you won‚Äôt have to worry about any site labels or watermarks on edited videos.

[Visit the online video reverser‚Äôs page](https://moviemakeronline.com/a/reverse-video) and drag-and-drop your video to start editing. It‚Äôs fairly straightforward and quick. Save and download your video, and you can reverse it to your heart‚Äôs content!

Movie Maker Online is a fantastic introductory platform if you‚Äôve no experiencing editing or reversing videos. Additional features include the ability to trim, merge and rotate videos.

### 8. Resizegram

No list talking about online video reverser tools would be complete without mention of Resizegram. Everything beautifully as you‚Äôd expect straight out of your browser like the other online video reversers.

Choose your [file](https://www.resizegram.com/reverse-video/) by browsing from your device or drag-and-drop directly. Resizegram supports videos as large as half a gigabyte, so if you‚Äôre planning to upload large files, it could take up to 10 minutes or more, depending on your internet connection.

While your file is getting uploaded, you need to keep your browser window open, although you can safely browse other websites during this time. If your file is taking longer than 30 minutes to upload, you‚Äôll need to upload again as the video conversion process can sometimes get stuck.

**Pros**

* Preferred by many as a great free online video reverser tool
* All you need is a modern web browser and that‚Äôs it
* Very simple to use even for those who have never done any video reversing online
* Works seamlessly with iPhone, Android, Windows and Mac devices
* Option to manually remove files from the Resizegram server
* No registration required ‚Äì just upload your file and enjoy

**Cons**

* Even though the 500MB file size cap seems generous enough, it may not be sufficient for some ‚Äòpower‚Äô reverse video creators
* The upload process can be slow, especially the larger your file size is towards the above cap

**In closing**

With a myriad of free online video reverser tools to choose from, there are options a plenty for everyone ‚Äì from the most basic of users to advanced users who love to create and market reversed videos for a living.

If the upload file size is an issue for you, for example, then you may prefer certain online reverse video makers over others. All in all, each one of the above we‚Äôve reviewed should give you plenty of options to play around with, as you and your audience or friends get entertained over some reverse video silliness!
