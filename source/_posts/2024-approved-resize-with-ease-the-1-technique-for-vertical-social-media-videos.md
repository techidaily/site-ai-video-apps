**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

![Trending Apps in 2019 for iPhone - Steller Discover·Create·Share Stories](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/steller-app-for-creating-share-stories.jpg)

It has already been five years since Steller was named as one of the best apps on the App Store by Apple, but very little has changed in the meantime. You don’t have to be a professional storyteller in order to create engaging visual stories with this app since you can select a theme you like and let Steller do all the heavy lifting for you. There just ten text styles to choose from and the app doesn’t offer even the basic video editing tools, which limits your options throughout the video editing process. Nonetheless, you can share all video content you edit with Steller directly to your Instagram Stories.

You can apply ten different filters and effects to all videos you record with this app and then choose from over 150 video templates. Unfold also grants you access to advanced text tools that enable you to customize the messages you want to distribute through social media channels. The free version of Unfold offers only a limited range of options, and you must upgrade to Unfold+ if you want to access all of the themes, fonts, and stickers this app provides. Despite the great user rating, Unfold still lacks video and audio editing tools that would allow its users to manipulate their footage without any restrictions.

### 8\. [24 FPS – Video Filter & LUT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/24fps-video-filter-lut/id1341136787)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** Requires iOS 12.0 or later

In addition to excellent video recording capabilities, this app features a plethora of options you can use to enhance the colors in the videos you edit. Importing LUTs into 24 FPS is a routine operation that can reduce the amount of time you have to spend on giving a video a particular cinematic style. Skin-thinning and skin smoothing filters enable you to beautify the people in your videos and make them more visually appealing to the online audience. The app’s video editor also contains audio editing options that make creating a video’s soundtrack fun and enjoyable.

### 9\. [VUE – Video Camera and Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vue-video-camera-and-editor/id1458609369)

Besides offering more than twenty filters, Vue also lets you change a video’s playback speed, merge or split multiple clips and enhance the colors of each clip you edit. The seemingly endless library of royalty-free songs offers you all the resources you are going to need while creating a soundtrack for your video, and you can also control the volume of video’s original sound and audio files you added to a project.

### 10 [1 Second Every Day: Video Diary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1-second-everyday-video-diary/id587823548)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

### Step 9

Once you have finished trimming your video with Video Trimmer Kapwing, click the Export Video button.

## Extra Information About Kapwing Editor

Now that you know how to trim videos with Kapwing Video Trimmer let's look at five things about this online editing tool that you need to know.

#### 1\. You Can Cut and Split Parts of Your Videos

With the Kapwing Video Editing tool, you can cut out the middle of your video clip by using the split key.

#### 2\. How to Collaborate With Kapwing

Kapwing allows you to work as a group remotely and in real-time while accessing each other's files. The tool is also ideal for teams, outsourced workers, and virtual assistants. All you have to do is invite your peers or colleagues to a Workspace, and Kaping will allow you to work together on GIF, video, and image edits.

To share your Kapwing Workspace to collaborate with other users without giving them your log-in information, follow the steps below.

* Simply go to the folder you would like to share and hit the Share button.
* You'll then have to type in the email address of the person you want to share the folder with.
* Once you have done this, click the Send Invite button to copy and send a link to an invitation to your folder.

Your collaborator needs to open the email with the link and click Join Now. They'll also have to create an account by linking their Facebook or Google account and then accept the invite again once they have signed in.

#### 3\. You Can Add Audio and Text to Your Video

Kapwing editor allows you to add audio and text using two methods: subtitles and text boxes. Use single text boxes for information, names, titles, and labels. To do this, hit the Text button located in the upper toolbar, then enter the text you want into the box.

All the text editing options will appear on the right, including angle, position, style, outline, color, and font. The Anime tab allows you to add up to 10 different animations to the text box. Additionally, you can add subtitles to your videos if you want your audience to follow along while listening to the spoken words in the video.

#### 4\. Share Your Videos With Others

After creating your video project, you can share it with others from the download page. You can share your video directly on Instagram. Twitter, and Facebook. You can also copy the video's link and then send it to anyone you want, and they will be able to view it.
