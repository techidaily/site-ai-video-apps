Metadata is the pieces of information that help viewers understand what a video is about without having to watch it from start to finish. Things like titles, keywords, tags, timestamps, and descriptions are some metadata that should be added to a video before it is published online.

Adding the right metadata to your video is useful for many reasons. It makes it easy for search engines to correctly identify and index your video. This in turn helps viewers find your video when they search Google, iTunes, or video sharing platforms like YouTube and Vimeo.

For more experienced videographers, metadata is useful at every stage of the process of making a video, from production to post-production and publishing. Without the right metadata, professional video production and editing would be a very uphill task.

The best multimedia editors have metadata editing features. It’s also good to have a lightweight, standalone application to edit and customize video metadata quickly. In this post, we share the 8 best video metadata editors for macOS users.

## 8 Best Video Metadata Editors for Mac

### 1. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is a powerful, easy-to-use multimedia editor released in early 2019\. It’s a new and improved version of the classic Filmora video editor, with many features on par with elite video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro. It can be purchased for roughly $60 though a trial version is available for free.

**FEATURES:** This software makes video editing easy with lots of extras like built-in audio tracks, sound effects, title presets, transition effects, and more. FilmoraPro lets users add metadata during the export process. Simply click the export button, which is now at the top of the media window. In the pop-up screen, click on the YouTube, Vimeo, or DVD tab, depending on how you want to publish your video, and edit the title, description, tags, category and privacy settings accordingly.

### 2. [iFlicks](https://iflicks.app/)

iFlicks is a media conversion and video metadata editor for macOS. In addition to being able to perform a variety of video format conversions, iFlicks supports detailed metadata editing and interacts seamlessly with iTunes. This app is available for a one-time fee or on a subscription basis.

Before you open Cloud Stop Motion and start clicking pictures of your subject for your video, it is important to have a story in mind. So, create a storyboard to break down your stop motion video. You can sketch your plan frame by frame or write bulleted list of your frames. It will help you create your project efficiently, ensuring that you have taken pictures of all the frames that you need to tell your story.

![adding new project on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-project-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Step 1: Once you have created your storyboard, open the app to go to the Cloud Stop Motion dashboard. Click on the new project button. Cloud Stop Motion needs access to your camera for capturing images. So, allow camera access.

![allowing access to camera on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/allowing-access-to-camera-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

On the dashboard, go to the taking picture menu. Now place the subject at the center of your frame. Capture a few test shots to find the composition that you like. You can see the picture at the bottom of the timeline. If needed, adjust the position of your subject. Make sure that the location you choose has plenty of light. If not, you also use a lamp for good light.

Tip: Keeping your phone or camera steady while making your stop-motion project is the key. You can use a tripod, a selfie stick, or a gimbal to keep your device as still as possible. If you don't own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.

Step 2: Move your subject or change its position and take a picture. Repeat the process until you complete your story. To make your stop-motion smooth, make small changes to the position of your subject between shots.

![capturing images on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/capturing-images-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

You can also add more frames per second. Generally, you should add 10 frames per second. But you can go for 25 frames per second to make a smoother video. All the pictures you snap are automatically added to the editor in chronological order.

Step 3: Once you have captured images for your project, add sound by going to the sound menu in the top left of the dashboard. You can record sounds, upload sounds, or select sounds from Cloud Stop Motion's gallery. You can also add text to your Cloud Stop Motion project if you want.

Step 4: Click on play button to preview your project and see if your motion picture turned out as per your liking or not. If you do not like something, go back and make changes. Once done, download your video from cloudstop motion.

 With the above comparison, it is safe to say that the top three video converters are Blender, HyperEngine AV and Wondershare. But Wondershare has a slight edge over the two in terms of space taken and mode variations. Due to its two modes, novice users as well as professionals can perform great editing of videos, photos and audios. It supports photo editing which is a great plus for the users. It works as a good downloader and converter too. That is definitely a plus for all who use this software. Again, the compatibility is a great factor working towards its favor.
