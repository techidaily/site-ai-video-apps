Microsoft has released **Windows Live Movie Maker** on August 19, 2009 as part of a refresh to their Windows Live Essentials download. Windows Live Movie Maker is the first application designed for Windows 7 and is built to make beautiful movies from your photos and videos. And the latest version is **Windows Live Movie Maker 2011**.

**Update in 2017:** Microsoft has stopped the Windows Essentials Suite support on January 10, 2017\. It is claimed that it is no longer available for download. If you are looking for an alternative to windows essentials movie maker, or windows movie maker, try Filmora video editor, which is available on both Windows7, Windows8 and Windows 10.
