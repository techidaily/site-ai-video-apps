****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

We’ve picked out some of the best **audio converters** available right now based on several different factors

You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert Audio?](#Part 1)

02 [How we tested the best audio converter software?](#Part 2)

03 [Essential Features of Audio Converter Software](#Part 3)

04 [What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

****Step 4: Start Conversion!**

Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting 'CONVERT’.

![Start conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%204.png)

****Step 5: Download or Save File!**

Once the conversion has been completed, your **audio converter** will either give you an option to 'DOWNLOAD’ or 'SAVE’ the finished product to your device!

![Download or Save Converted Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%205.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…

02 [How we tested the best audio converter software?](#Part 2)

03 [Essential Features of Audio Converter Software](#Part 3)

04 [What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

****Step 4: Start Conversion!**

Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting 'CONVERT’.

![Start conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%204.png)

****Step 5: Download or Save File!**

Once the conversion has been completed, your **audio converter** will either give you an option to 'DOWNLOAD’ or 'SAVE’ the finished product to your device!

![Download or Save Converted Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%205.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…
