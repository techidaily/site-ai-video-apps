Let's have a look at how you can stabilize your videos with these free online video stabilizers.

#### 1. [EZGIF Online Video Stabilizer](https://ezgif.com/video-stabilizer)

You don't have to worry about the video's format, because the platform supports nearly all popular file formats like MP4, AVI, or MPEG. Here's how you can stabilize your video with EZGIF Online Video Stabilizer.

**Step 1:** Once you open the Video Stabilizer option, you will be asked to either upload the video you'd like to stabilize from the hard drive on your computer or paste the video's URL if the clip you want to stabilize is stored online. Hit the Upload Video button after you perform either of these actions and wait for the upload process to be finalized.

**Step 2:** To initiate the video stabilization process, you just have to click on the Stabilize button. The process will start automatically and its duration depends on the size of the file you're stabilizing.

**Step 3:** Once the process is complete your video will appear in the Stabilized Video box, where you can preview it before downloading it as an MP4 file to your computer. You must click on the Save icon below the video to start the downloading the video.

Alternatively, you can click on the Upload your movie button or you can upload the video using Dropbox, OneDrive or Google Drive.
