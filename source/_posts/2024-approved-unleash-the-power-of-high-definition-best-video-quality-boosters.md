**Price:** Free

LightMV is a video content creation platform that allows its users to turn their photos into videos. Simply choose a template from Social Media, Fashion, or Travel categories and upload the images to the template. The number of images you can include in a video trailer varies from template to template, although you can purchase lollies, the platform’s virtual money, that enables you to increase the number of images you can add to a template. Even though all templates have built-in soundtracks, you can add a new song from the platform’s music library or from your computer. LightMV can be used from a web browser, installed as software on a PC computer or downloaded as an app from Google Play or App Store.

**Pros**

* LightMV offers an easy way to turn photos into videos
* All templates are easily customizable
* Equipped with basic audio editing tools
* Good social sharing options

**Cons**

* Downloading videos is only possible if you purchase lollies
* No video editing tools

**Conclusion**

All film productions regardless of how big or small they are can benefit from online promotion. Each of the online video trailer makers we featured in this article is easy to use, and you don’t need a lot of video editing experience in order to customize a video trailer template.

Well, if you want to make a fully tailored trailer, I highly suggest you download Filmora with the buttons below. It definitely gives you the best value.

Video creation is on the increase, especially with smartphones and easy-to-reach tablets. Simply take a video to share with your loved ones. However, it would make a great difference if you edited your video and added other lovely precepts for detailed expression. Unfortunately, most people find it challenging to create quality videos on their phones.

In most cases, they’ll need to move them to their desktops for polishing and advanced editing. That’s not the case anymore, especially, with the rise of mobile editing applications like the Splice app. It lets you easily create high-quality video content with just a few clicks.

## What Exactly Is Splice?

The Splice video editor is a mobile editing tool initially developed by the GoPro Company but recently landed at the doors of Bending Spoons Company. After its update in September 2020, this app gained thousands of customer ratings, close to five-star ratings. It is a mobile video editor compatible with Android and iPhone mobile devices. The numerous effects and tools make it possible for you to create eye-catching videos for use and export.

More so, Splice contains several features that are ready to turn your video into an imaginary piece of work. The user interface is quite intuitive, and you can easily navigate even if you are a beginner. Its library is quite extensive, with tons of royalty-free music. You are also not limited to adding any of your favorite sound effects. And when it comes to uploading your video, do it directly to media sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, among other sites. The only drawback is occasional crashing, especially if handling bulky videos.

### Splice App Advantages

* It is simple to use and has an intuitive user interface.

* Directly upload your completed video to social media sites like YouTube and Instagram.
