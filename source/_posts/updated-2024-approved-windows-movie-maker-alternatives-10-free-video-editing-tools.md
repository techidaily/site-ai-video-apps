 You can now easily capture screenshots on your PS4 with the inclusion of the new _SHARE_ button on the DualShock 4 controller. This can be done either through the short or long press settings configured for your _SHARE_ button. Kindly follow me through the different options that you have on how you can capture and share your PS4 screenshots; **Option 1: Through the SHARE button** or; **Option 2: On A Separate Platform**.

## Capture screenshots on PS4 with SHARE button

 You can’t miss the _SHARE_ button on the new controller for the latest PS4\. It’s sitting on the left-hand side of the touch pad (as shown in the screenshot below). A short press on _SHARE_ button (by default) will take you into the Share’s interface. In order to capture a screen shot, you’ll need to perform a long press. Alternatively, change your _Share Settings_ to _Easy Screenshots_ where the press works in contrary of the defaulted settings.

Once the template opens you can **upload the pictures** from your computer or from Facebook and Instagram. You’ll also be able to add **new shapes and text layers** to the template or change its background. Each visual or textual element you decide to include in your photo collage can be edited so that it fits the visual style of the collage perfectly. **The watermark is going to be added** to all your creations if you decide to use the free version of Photovisi.

Photo Collage Maker lets you choose from more than **250 photo collage templates** that are suitable for virtually any purpose. The number of pictures you can include in a photo collage can vary from just **two to more than 75** and it depends on the template you choose. You can also automatically desaturate all the images in a photo collage by clicking on the **B&W/Color icon** or **change the background** with a single click. Photo Collage Maker doesn’t offer any border options, so you can’t really control the spacing between the images. Downloading a 1-megapixel file from this platform is going to cost you $5.56.
