It's very easy today to become proficient enough to shoot high-quality videos for entertainment, for business and to assist with teaching. Sony is one of the brands that are popular with video makers, and in this tutorial we walk you through the steps on editing videos shot by Sony camcorder.

## How to Edit Videos Shot by Sony Digital Camcorder

### Video editing software for Sony camcorder

Video editing software is tiered by level, with options available for basic, mediate, and advanced programs. Here's a closer look at select software options:

* [Basic Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders](#part1)
* [Mediate Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders](#part2)
* [Advanced Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders](#part2)

### Basic Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders

#### 1\. Wondershare Filmora

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (Latest version X) is not only one of the most affordable video editing software options, it's also one of the most advanced. The interface is simple, but there are numerous advanced features available, including overlays, filters, audio editing features and more.

### Mediate Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders

#### 1\. Magix Movie Edit Pro

#### 2\. Lightworks

It has an extensive list of features and capabilities that provide as near to professional performance as you can find in a free video editing program. The learning curve is a little steep, but if you're willing to invest the time then you have access to a powerful program.

### Advanced Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders

![video editor for sony camcorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movie-studio.jpg)

**Final tip**: Understand what you want and balance your needs against your budget and your interest in learning a new application, then you will be able to select the best software to edit videos shot on your Sony camcorder.
