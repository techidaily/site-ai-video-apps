![iMovie Online Alternative - Adobe Spark](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Adobe-Spark.JPG)

You don’t need advanced video editing skills to create a video with Adobe Spark, but you must create an account on this platform before you can start working on a new project.

Besides making videos, you can use Adobe Spark to edit photos and [create Facebook covers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Instagram posts in just a few clicks, since the platform offers more than 20,000 different templates. Adobe Spark lets you share all of your creations on social media, but you should keep in mind that you can only customize your branding if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.

**Pros:**

* A perfect social media marketing tool
* No previous video editing experience required
* Excellent social sharing options
* Offers both video and photo editing tools

**Cons:**

* Collaborating with other Adobe Spark users isn’t possible with the free version of the app

In addition, you can also apply transitions and visual effects to your footage, and send it to your friends and colleagues via email or share it on social media.

![iMovie Online Alternative -Kizoa](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kizoa-online-video-editor.jpg)

However, you won’t be able to create videos longer than one minute or export videos in resolutions larger than 720p if you opt for the free version of Kizoa. If you choose the Business version of this video editing platform, you will be able to create 4K videos, and you’ll have access to unlimited cloud storage space.

Moreover, selecting this pricing model will enable you to use RAW format images in all your projects and burn your videos to DVDs. Keep in mind that the maximum duration of the video you can create with Kizoa depends on the type of license you choose.

**Pros:**

* Supports 4K video editing

![iMovie Online Alternative WeVideo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wevideo-online-video-editor.jpg)

However, the free version of this online video editor only allows you to export five minutes of video per month while limiting the resolution to just 480p. That’s why choosing the Unlimited, Professional, or Business subscription plans that have no publish time or cloud storage restrictions is a much better option.
