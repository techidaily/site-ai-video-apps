It's an age-old battle, [Vegas](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/) or [Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html), a comparison that many have made over the last few years in the market, as always when making a comparison, things are always skewed by the writer's own views, so it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions. Here we aim to lay out the specifications of each product and discuss their effects on workflow, output, and usability to form an opinion beyond the 'this is the one I like' argument. However, we are aware of making a completely fair comparison is impossible. We will try our best. Hope you will enjoy it!

Again the [Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html), and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of 'things', so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere's more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.

Underneath the [Vegas specifications](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/) though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.

I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is [the major difference for new users](https://www.udemy.com/). This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe's own online video education for the software.

#### 2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison

As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. [Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows](https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases), and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn't even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.

It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn't tell the whole story, with the audio and [effect modules more advanced in Premiere](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html), however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.

#### 3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison

Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of [media formats](https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html) \- of Adobe's product makes it a superior product for long-term use.

The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.

#### 4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison

There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe's strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and [in the case of video effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.

## Part 2: FAQ about Vegas

### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.

It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW [Digital Audio Workstation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.

A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.

I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.

Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.

### 2\. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?

No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.

Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.

Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas â€˜Proâ€™ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.

Both come at a premium cost anyway.

### 3\. How much does Sony Vegas cost?

There are [different plans of the Sony Vegas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) such as Vegas Pro Edit, Vegas Pro, Vegas Pro 365, Vegas Pro Suite. The Vegas Pro Edit generally costs around $698\. Next, The Vegas Pro comes at the cost of $898\. The popular Vegas Pro 365 is priced at $16.67 for every 3 months.

So, you need to pay a total of $66.68 annually. Lastly, the Sony Vegas Pro Suite comes at $1098 and is the costliest of all the versions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Premiere is the more capable program, both in terms of workflow, output, and its ability to integrate with other applications to produce much more advanced output. For anyone looking for more than just an editor, it is the choice to make. Find some instructional material, dive in, and have fun.

Again the [Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html), and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of 'things', so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere's more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.

Underneath the [Vegas specifications](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/) though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.

I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is [the major difference for new users](https://www.udemy.com/). This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe's own online video education for the software.

#### 2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison

As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. [Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows](https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases), and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn't even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.

It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn't tell the whole story, with the audio and [effect modules more advanced in Premiere](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html), however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.

#### 3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison

Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of [media formats](https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html) \- of Adobe's product makes it a superior product for long-term use.

The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.

#### 4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison

There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe's strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and [in the case of video effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.

## Part 2: FAQ about Vegas

### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.

It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW [Digital Audio Workstation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.

A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.

I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.

Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.

### 2\. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?

No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.

Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.

Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas â€˜Proâ€™ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.

Both come at a premium cost anyway.

### 3\. How much does Sony Vegas cost?

There are [different plans of the Sony Vegas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) such as Vegas Pro Edit, Vegas Pro, Vegas Pro 365, Vegas Pro Suite. The Vegas Pro Edit generally costs around $698\. Next, The Vegas Pro comes at the cost of $898\. The popular Vegas Pro 365 is priced at $16.67 for every 3 months.

So, you need to pay a total of $66.68 annually. Lastly, the Sony Vegas Pro Suite comes at $1098 and is the costliest of all the versions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Premiere is the more capable program, both in terms of workflow, output, and its ability to integrate with other applications to produce much more advanced output. For anyone looking for more than just an editor, it is the choice to make. Find some instructional material, dive in, and have fun.

It's an age-old battle, [Vegas](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/) or [Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html), a comparison that many have made over the last few years in the market, as always when making a comparison, things are always skewed by the writer's own views, so it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions. Here we aim to lay out the specifications of each product and discuss their effects on workflow, output, and usability to form an opinion beyond the 'this is the one I like' argument. However, we are aware of making a completely fair comparison is impossible. We will try our best. Hope you will enjoy it!

The app allows users to shoot, edit, and publish their videos and basically acts as a full-scale portable production studio capable of creating professional-looking movie trailers or even short films. Among the numerous advanced features, iMovie supports split-screen and picture-in-picture options, while also making it very simple to add titles or credits in a wide variety of styles. Because of this, it can be sufficient for anyone whose editing needs are not too complex. Even professional users can start working in iMovie before switching to a more robust Apple editing tool such as Final Cut Pro X.

### 2\. [PicPlay Post Movie Video Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flambestudios.picplaypost&hl=en)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - PicPlayPost ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-movie-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile tool can be used to create and edit video clips or photo collages with a broad range of eye-catching features. It supports the split screen option with up to 9 tiles organized in a 3 x 3 pattern, and offers a lot of pre-defined backgrounds and layouts. Most importantly, you can choose between 9:16 and 16:9 aspect ratios, so the outgoing clips are ready for sharing on any social media platform in landscape or portrait orientation. Itâ€™s perfect for creating simple side-by-side comparisons as well as more complex collages that consist of still photos, GIFs, and video clips. The app is easy to use and requires very little training to achieve spectacular results.

### 3\. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-collage-and-photo-grid/id779353036)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Collage and Photo Grid ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

The advantage of any specialized app is that it can perform the chosen function very well, and in the case of a video collage app that means a lot of split screen presets and customization opportunities. You can choose from 64 different layouts featuring up to four videos that can play at the same time. All layouts can be manually adjusted to get the best possible fit with your content, while frame textures can be changed as well. The resulting video collage can be combined with music for a true multimedia feel. Instant preview is a very useful feature as well since it allows the authors to experiment freely while they are searching for the perfect layout of the screen.

### 4\. [Split Screen Video](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/split-screen-videos/id1141913470#?platform=iphone)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** $2.99

![Split Screen Video Making App -Split Screen Video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-videos-app.jpg)

With this simple digital tool, you can easily combine from two to four videos into a great, dynamic clip. This is an Apple-only application and has a modest price considering the range of its features. Videos can be placed into frames, and their size and style can be adjusted at will so that some tiles are larger than others. For those who enjoy speed and convenience, there are six preset layouts that can be used to quickly put together a stunning split screen video. Since the interface is extremely user-friendly, this can take as little as a few minutes to execute.

### 5\. [Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/perfect-video-editor-collage/id633335631)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perfect-video-editor-collage.jpg)

There are numerous advantages of this split screen video app, starting from the simplicity of use that makes it ideal for beginners and casual users. Perfect Video Editor supports practically every aspect ratio you can think of, so it works well as a universal editing tool regardless of the intended use of the video. The split screen feature is sadly limited to just two video channels, somewhat limiting the range of options at your disposal. Picture and picture and chroma key features can partially make up for this limitation, along with animated subtitles and great transitions that add some extra oomph to the final product.

### 6 [Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram/id712908978)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram.jpg)

You can do a lot of different things with this video editing app, although itâ€™s best suited for the creation of Instagram videos. The free version is available for both major OS platforms, but in order to use full features on your iPhone, you might need to make a $0.99 in-app purchase. The app lets you combine photos and videos, and place them into one of many predefined and fully adjustable split screen frames and collage formats. However, this app works best with clips made from your own phone and may not be the best choice if you need to import multimedia from diverse sources. Considering that most social media users these days shoot and edit their clips in the same breath, Vidstitch Frames could be sufficiently advanced for their needs.

### 7\. [Acapella](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acapella-from-picplaypost/id924635678)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Acapella](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/acapella-from-picplaypost.jpg)

While this is primarily a music editing app, it can also be used with reasonable success for creating and sharing videos. Most importantly, it supports multi-frame layouts and allows you to combine several video clips to accompany the multi-track sound. Various frames and backgrounds are available to use as plug-and-play elements while you are making a new split screen video. The songs and videos you can record with Acapella are limited to 10 minutes in duration, although this should be more than enough for all except the most ambitious users. On the other hand, demanding users who primarily want to edit videos rather than music can probably find a better split screen app.

### 8\. [Video Merge, Side by Side](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.irisstudio.videomerge&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Merge, Side by Side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-merge-side-by-side.jpg)

Installing this Android app will instantly enable you to create unique videos by merging two different clips into one. The app shows both streams together and can place them side by side or one atop of another, depending on user preference. This is a great way to show two different shots of the same event or summarize the footage from your travels without spending a ton of time. While the app is very intuitive and easy to learn, it canâ€™t work with more than two video sources and it sorely lacks some of the more sophisticated features that a premium split screen video editor should have.

### 9\. [4xcamera](https://www.roland.com/us/products/4xcamera/)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

As its name implies, 4Xcamera can handle up to four independent inputs containing both video and audio components. As such, it can be a powerful tool for recording live music performances and editing the footage to get amazing multi-screen music videos. Each of the performers can be in a separate location, but this split screen app allows for simultaneous recording and real-time playback in a very effortless fashion. Three aspect ratios are supported (1:1, 9:16, and 16:9), along with 10 unique split screen patterns for each of those formats. The free version is available from the App Store as well as Google Play, although paid features might be necessary for the best possible results.

### 10\. [Multiple Videos at Same Time](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.badongutech.playvideos4fun&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

This practical and intuitive split screen software can play up to four different videos at the same time, albeit only in the basic layout with four equally sized fields. It is best suited for playback rather than video editing, and most of the options are basic viewing-related commands such as rewinding, searching, or volume control. On a more positive note, this app can be easily connected to a large screen TV or a movie projector and used for multi-screen promotions and presentations. The app has minimal hardware requirements and is extremely easy to use, even for a person with no experience in multimedia production. Itâ€™s fair to say that the app has a clearly defined target group and serves well in its primary role, but it doesnâ€™t compare favorably with some of the general purpose editors presented earlier.

**Conclusion**

The field is quite broad when it comes to split screen video apps, with numerous high-quality products available for free or at a low cost. The most optimal choice of editing software depends on numerous factors, including the level of experience and the purpose of the videos. With so many options to choose from, every advanced social media user can create brilliant videos that combine multiple sources and create a dynamic, modern format. It takes some practice to master the split screen tool and get the layout just right without overwhelming the viewer, but this is easier to achieve when you have professional-level editing tools installed on your smartphone.

### 5\. [Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/perfect-video-editor-collage/id633335631)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perfect-video-editor-collage.jpg)

There are numerous advantages of this split screen video app, starting from the simplicity of use that makes it ideal for beginners and casual users. Perfect Video Editor supports practically every aspect ratio you can think of, so it works well as a universal editing tool regardless of the intended use of the video. The split screen feature is sadly limited to just two video channels, somewhat limiting the range of options at your disposal. Picture and picture and chroma key features can partially make up for this limitation, along with animated subtitles and great transitions that add some extra oomph to the final product.

### 6 [Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram/id712908978)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram.jpg)

You can do a lot of different things with this video editing app, although itâ€™s best suited for the creation of Instagram videos. The free version is available for both major OS platforms, but in order to use full features on your iPhone, you might need to make a $0.99 in-app purchase. The app lets you combine photos and videos, and place them into one of many predefined and fully adjustable split screen frames and collage formats. However, this app works best with clips made from your own phone and may not be the best choice if you need to import multimedia from diverse sources. Considering that most social media users these days shoot and edit their clips in the same breath, Vidstitch Frames could be sufficiently advanced for their needs.

### 7\. [Acapella](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acapella-from-picplaypost/id924635678)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Acapella](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/acapella-from-picplaypost.jpg)

While this is primarily a music editing app, it can also be used with reasonable success for creating and sharing videos. Most importantly, it supports multi-frame layouts and allows you to combine several video clips to accompany the multi-track sound. Various frames and backgrounds are available to use as plug-and-play elements while you are making a new split screen video. The songs and videos you can record with Acapella are limited to 10 minutes in duration, although this should be more than enough for all except the most ambitious users. On the other hand, demanding users who primarily want to edit videos rather than music can probably find a better split screen app.

### 8\. [Video Merge, Side by Side](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.irisstudio.videomerge&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Merge, Side by Side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-merge-side-by-side.jpg)

Installing this Android app will instantly enable you to create unique videos by merging two different clips into one. The app shows both streams together and can place them side by side or one atop of another, depending on user preference. This is a great way to show two different shots of the same event or summarize the footage from your travels without spending a ton of time. While the app is very intuitive and easy to learn, it canâ€™t work with more than two video sources and it sorely lacks some of the more sophisticated features that a premium split screen video editor should have.

### 9\. [4xcamera](https://www.roland.com/us/products/4xcamera/)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

As its name implies, 4Xcamera can handle up to four independent inputs containing both video and audio components. As such, it can be a powerful tool for recording live music performances and editing the footage to get amazing multi-screen music videos. Each of the performers can be in a separate location, but this split screen app allows for simultaneous recording and real-time playback in a very effortless fashion. Three aspect ratios are supported (1:1, 9:16, and 16:9), along with 10 unique split screen patterns for each of those formats. The free version is available from the App Store as well as Google Play, although paid features might be necessary for the best possible results.

### 10\. [Multiple Videos at Same Time](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.badongutech.playvideos4fun&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

This practical and intuitive split screen software can play up to four different videos at the same time, albeit only in the basic layout with four equally sized fields. It is best suited for playback rather than video editing, and most of the options are basic viewing-related commands such as rewinding, searching, or volume control. On a more positive note, this app can be easily connected to a large screen TV or a movie projector and used for multi-screen promotions and presentations. The app has minimal hardware requirements and is extremely easy to use, even for a person with no experience in multimedia production. Itâ€™s fair to say that the app has a clearly defined target group and serves well in its primary role, but it doesnâ€™t compare favorably with some of the general purpose editors presented earlier.

**Conclusion**

The field is quite broad when it comes to split screen video apps, with numerous high-quality products available for free or at a low cost. The most optimal choice of editing software depends on numerous factors, including the level of experience and the purpose of the videos. With so many options to choose from, every advanced social media user can create brilliant videos that combine multiple sources and create a dynamic, modern format. It takes some practice to master the split screen tool and get the layout just right without overwhelming the viewer, but this is easier to achieve when you have professional-level editing tools installed on your smartphone.

As we use our mobile phones for producing and watching videos more and more every year, the demand for advanced options is constantly on the rise. Split screen is one of such options that users expect from their video apps nowadays, and products that include it stand a better chance to gain a steady foothold in the market. As a response, many new video tools equipped with the [split screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are being launched, but not all of them offer the same level of technical quality and user experience.

To help you differentiate between the competing apps and select the one that works best for you, we prepared an overview of the best split screen video apps for iOS and Android you can use to record, create, and share great-looking multimedia with minimal effort.

### 1\. [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

This is Appleâ€™s own video app and it is generally regarded as one of the better in its class, especially considering itâ€™s free to download. The app allows users to shoot, edit, and publish their videos and basically acts as a full-scale portable production studio capable of creating professional-looking movie trailers or even short films. Among the numerous advanced features, iMovie supports split-screen and picture-in-picture options, while also making it very simple to add titles or credits in a wide variety of styles. Because of this, it can be sufficient for anyone whose editing needs are not too complex. Even professional users can start working in iMovie before switching to a more robust Apple editing tool such as Final Cut Pro X.

### 2\. [PicPlay Post Movie Video Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flambestudios.picplaypost&hl=en)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - PicPlayPost ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-movie-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile tool can be used to create and edit video clips or photo collages with a broad range of eye-catching features. It supports the split screen option with up to 9 tiles organized in a 3 x 3 pattern, and offers a lot of pre-defined backgrounds and layouts. Most importantly, you can choose between 9:16 and 16:9 aspect ratios, so the outgoing clips are ready for sharing on any social media platform in landscape or portrait orientation. Itâ€™s perfect for creating simple side-by-side comparisons as well as more complex collages that consist of still photos, GIFs, and video clips. The app is easy to use and requires very little training to achieve spectacular results.

### 3\. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-collage-and-photo-grid/id779353036)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Collage and Photo Grid ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

The advantage of any specialized app is that it can perform the chosen function very well, and in the case of a video collage app that means a lot of split screen presets and customization opportunities. You can choose from 64 different layouts featuring up to four videos that can play at the same time. All layouts can be manually adjusted to get the best possible fit with your content, while frame textures can be changed as well. The resulting video collage can be combined with music for a true multimedia feel. Instant preview is a very useful feature as well since it allows the authors to experiment freely while they are searching for the perfect layout of the screen.

### 4\. [Split Screen Video](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/split-screen-videos/id1141913470#?platform=iphone)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** $2.99

![Split Screen Video Making App -Split Screen Video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-videos-app.jpg)

With this simple digital tool, you can easily combine from two to four videos into a great, dynamic clip. This is an Apple-only application and has a modest price considering the range of its features. Videos can be placed into frames, and their size and style can be adjusted at will so that some tiles are larger than others. For those who enjoy speed and convenience, there are six preset layouts that can be used to quickly put together a stunning split screen video. Since the interface is extremely user-friendly, this can take as little as a few minutes to execute.
