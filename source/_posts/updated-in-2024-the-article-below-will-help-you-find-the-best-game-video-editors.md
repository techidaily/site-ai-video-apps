## Top 10 Mac Video Tag Editors for Seamless Organization

# 8 Best Video Metadata Editor on Mac (Real and Easy)

Metadata is the pieces of information that help viewers understand what a video is about without having to watch it from start to finish. Things like titles, keywords, tags, timestamps, and descriptions are some metadata that should be added to a video before it is published online.

Adding the right metadata to your video is useful for many reasons. It makes it easy for search engines to correctly identify and index your video. This in turn helps viewers find your video when they search Google, iTunes, or video sharing platforms like YouTube and Vimeo.

For more experienced videographers, metadata is useful at every stage of the process of making a video, from production to post-production and publishing. Without the right metadata, professional video production and editing would be a very uphill task.

The best multimedia editors have metadata editing features. It’s also good to have a lightweight, standalone application to edit and customize video metadata quickly. In this post, we share the 8 best video metadata editors for macOS users.

## 8 Best Video Metadata Editors for Mac

### 1. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**FEATURES:** This software makes video editing easy with lots of extras like built-in audio tracks, sound effects, title presets, transition effects, and more. FilmoraPro lets users add metadata during the export process. Simply click the export button, which is now at the top of the media window. In the pop-up screen, click on the YouTube, Vimeo, or DVD tab, depending on how you want to publish your video, and edit the title, description, tags, category and privacy settings accordingly.

### 2. [iFlicks](https://iflicks.app/)

Metadata is the pieces of information that help viewers understand what a video is about without having to watch it from start to finish. Things like titles, keywords, tags, timestamps, and descriptions are some metadata that should be added to a video before it is published online.

Adding the right metadata to your video is useful for many reasons. It makes it easy for search engines to correctly identify and index your video. This in turn helps viewers find your video when they search Google, iTunes, or video sharing platforms like YouTube and Vimeo.

For more experienced videographers, metadata is useful at every stage of the process of making a video, from production to post-production and publishing. Without the right metadata, professional video production and editing would be a very uphill task.

The best multimedia editors have metadata editing features. It’s also good to have a lightweight, standalone application to edit and customize video metadata quickly. In this post, we share the 8 best video metadata editors for macOS users.

## 8 Best Video Metadata Editors for Mac

### 1. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is a powerful, easy-to-use multimedia editor released in early 2019\. It’s a new and improved version of the classic Filmora video editor, with many features on par with elite video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro. It can be purchased for roughly $60 though a trial version is available for free.

**FEATURES:** This software makes video editing easy with lots of extras like built-in audio tracks, sound effects, title presets, transition effects, and more. FilmoraPro lets users add metadata during the export process. Simply click the export button, which is now at the top of the media window. In the pop-up screen, click on the YouTube, Vimeo, or DVD tab, depending on how you want to publish your video, and edit the title, description, tags, category and privacy settings accordingly.

### 2. [iFlicks](https://iflicks.app/)

iFlicks is a media conversion and video metadata editor for macOS. In addition to being able to perform a variety of video format conversions, iFlicks supports detailed metadata editing and interacts seamlessly with iTunes. This app is available for a one-time fee or on a subscription basis.

**FEATURES:** The iFlicks metadata editor is superbly detailed with options for adding season and episode information for TV shows. Also available are fields for tagline, release date, genre, content rating, resolution, artwork, cast, and crew, etc. Some of these metadata will even be fetched automatically based on information available via iTunes.

![iFlicks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/iflicks-min.jpg)

### 3. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

VLC Media Player is the largest open-source media player in the world. Though primarily meant for playing media files, it has powerful features for video conversion, screen capture, downloading online videos, recording screening videos, and editing video metadata.

**FEATURES:** VLC's metadata editor can be found under MEDIA INFORMATION within the TOOLS menu in the top bar. Here, you can add information about the title, artist, album, publisher, and copyright of the video. VLC also lets users add custom metadata in a separate tab.

![VLC](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/VLC-metadata-min.jpg)

### 4. [Subler](https://subler.org/)

Subler is a free application for editing media metadata in macOS. It’s very barebones and efficient.

**FEATURES:** Subler actually loads the media file to be edited as separate audio and video files, allowing users to edit information about them individually. To edit metadata for the multimedia file, make sure neither the video nor the audio file is selected and click the metadata tab. Then, click the "+" button in the lower-left corner to see the long list of metadata you can add to the video.

![Subler](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Subler-min.jpg)

It also has a batch editing feature for updating metadata for multiple files simultaneously as well as a tool for editing media artworks. This application is a great option for media pros who often have to juggle and keep track of many media files at once.
