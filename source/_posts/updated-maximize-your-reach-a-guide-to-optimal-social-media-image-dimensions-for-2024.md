#### 1\. Import and add media files

To make a home movie using Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor), first you need to import videos, photos and audio to the album for later use. After running the software, choose 16:9 or 4:3 ratio, and a window like below will pop up. Click Import to select videos, audio and photos from your computer.

#### 2\. Edit and personalize your home movie

Video Editor enables you to easily personalize the movie.

* To customize title, drag and drop a title template to the position you want it to show up and customize it.
* To apply effects, choose from 50+ video effects, select it and apply to your photos/videos instantly.
* To add PIP, choose one from the template or your own photo collection and drag to the PIP Timeline. Here, you can also easily create Picture-in-Picture effect.
* To add transitions, drag and drop a transition template to the video/photo, or right click it to Apply to All.
* To add intro/credit, pick up your desired template, drag it between every two clips.
