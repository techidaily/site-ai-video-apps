 Reaching the widest audience possible is the goal of every video content creator, but achieving this goal might be impossible if the videos you share online are not saved in the right file format. [MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is probably the most common video file there is, because it is compatible with a broad range of [media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as well as [online video hosting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and social media platforms.

 Trimming the WebM videos is yet another option you will have at your disposal if you choose to convert your files with CloudConvert. In case you’re planning on using this file conversion platform on a regular basis, you can choose how many conversion minutes you’re going to have every month.

### 8\. [Video2Edit](https://www.video2edit.com/convert/webm-to-mp4)

 The platform offers batch conversion options, which can be quite useful if you are looking to convert multiple video files quickly. It is worth noting that converting a video larger than 500MB with this platform isn’t possible, regardless of the subscription model you choose. The number of daily conversions, however, is not limited.

### 10\. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/webm-to-mp4/)

You just have to select the source from which you want to import the video, select the output format and decide if you want to change the [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or size.

 When done, simply click on the Convert Now button and then after the conversion process is completed, proceed to download your video to your computer. The only downside is that you cannot convert WebM video files that are larger than 200MB with Aconvert.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files. Which WebM to MP4 converter do you like to use the most? Share your opinions with us in the comments.

 When done, simply click on the Convert Now button and then after the conversion process is completed, proceed to download your video to your computer. The only downside is that you cannot convert WebM video files that are larger than 200MB with Aconvert.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files. Which WebM to MP4 converter do you like to use the most? Share your opinions with us in the comments.

 Reaching the widest audience possible is the goal of every video content creator, but achieving this goal might be impossible if the videos you share online are not saved in the right file format. [MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is probably the most common video file there is, because it is compatible with a broad range of [media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as well as [online video hosting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and social media platforms.

# Best Video Maker for Mac: Easily make videos on Mac

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Finding a good video maker for Mac is not always easy – not for lack of options, there are many applications out there, but there are **two main limitations**: money, first and foremost, we all know how expensive video makers – good video makers – can be. The second limitation is complexity: sometimes you end up spending more time reading the help instead of editing, and the application you've chosen probably contains the features that you need – except that you have serious problems finding them on the menu.

[1\. Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac](#part1)  
[2\. iMovie](#part2)  
[3\. Blender](#part3)

## Best Video Maker for Mac

Some video makers manage to stay on top by avoiding, or at least limiting these problems, and here are three of those.

### 1.Vieo Maker on Mac: [Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora for Mac offers perhaps the best value for money (not to mention that it has a free version as well if you'd like to try it first. It supports pretty much any format you may think of (AVI, MP4, MOV, MPG, MKV, TRP, and so on), and it's quite easy to use when it comes to the most basic features you'd expect in a video editor, such as cropping, joining, trimming, and rotating, as well as for adding some effects, transitions, and sound effects.

Because of that, Wondershare Filmora may actually be deceptively simple – because it's capable of much more powerful features, if you take your time to study all its options, such as **picture in picture, green screen**, if you fancy yourself the next Hollywood director, adjustable playback speed, separation of the audio track from the original video file, tilt-shift effects, which can create very interesting results in a video, automatic noise reduction, and image enhancement, to bring back to life the subjects of the video, and automatic scene detection – allowing you to create a new video clip every time a scene changes. And there are a lot more things you can discover for yourself if you spend some time playing around.

Wondershare Filmora will also allow you to upload your creations directly to **Facebook or YouTube**, or to burn them on DVDs, so you can get straight into the next project without wasting any time.

### 2\. Video Maker for Mac: iMovie

iMovie is the proprietary software provided by Apple as part of its iLife suit. You may find it already installed on your Mac if you've just purchased a new machine. If not, it's free to use after you purchase iLife.

It's not the most powerful and complex application out there, as you can imagine for a piece of software that comes pre-installed, but it's a good first stop for people who are just starting out in this field and need to learn the basics of editing videos on Mac without too many headaches.

It has many easy-to-use effects and lots of build-in animations, music samples, and sounds to get you started on your first project immediately.

Granted, iMovie has sacrificed a lot of features for the simplicity of use – sooner or later you'll want to move on to something more complex, but, for beginners and for people who just need to add a few editing touches to a project here and there, this is a more than the reasonable solution. Don't let yourself put off by the fact iMovie has a rather bad reputation online – of course, that very advanced users are disappointed by it, but you can use it for a while and you'll know when it's time to move on.

### 3\. Video Maker on Mac: Blender

When you've exhausted the possibilities offered by iMovie and you need more power, Blender will be there, waiting for you. It's by far the most impressive of the free video makers for Mac – it's an open-source program, developed by the community – so it's always free to use, you won't stumble upon any hidden charges later on.

Like all open source applications, Blender is not the most intuitive at the first glance, but it more than compensates with the impressive range of features that bring it to the same level as a professional application. If you've been struggling to get everything just perfect before, now you'll have everything you need at your fingertips and you only need to unleash your imagination. It's 3D modeling options have been frequently compared to those that can only be found in applications that cost more than your Mac (maybe even more than your car, come to think of it).

Moreover, the community will always be there for you – if you have any questions or if you get stuck, you only need to post a question online and somebody will be there to help you out – not to mention the very large number of tutorials available online, with more being added almost daily.

If you're not sure about this, you may want to start by searching online for clips created entirely with Blender. Of course, yours won't be masterpieces from day one, it will take some time to get used to this application – but you'll get some idea of how powerful it can be, and the level of mastery that you'll want to achieve, eventually.

Finding a good video maker for Mac is not always easy – not for lack of options, there are many applications out there, but there are **two main limitations**: money, first and foremost, we all know how expensive video makers – good video makers – can be. The second limitation is complexity: sometimes you end up spending more time reading the help instead of editing, and the application you've chosen probably contains the features that you need – except that you have serious problems finding them on the menu.

[1\. Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac](#part1)  
[2\. iMovie](#part2)  
[3\. Blender](#part3)

## Best Video Maker for Mac

Some video makers manage to stay on top by avoiding, or at least limiting these problems, and here are three of those.

### 1.Vieo Maker on Mac: [Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora for Mac offers perhaps the best value for money (not to mention that it has a free version as well if you'd like to try it first. It supports pretty much any format you may think of (AVI, MP4, MOV, MPG, MKV, TRP, and so on), and it's quite easy to use when it comes to the most basic features you'd expect in a video editor, such as cropping, joining, trimming, and rotating, as well as for adding some effects, transitions, and sound effects.

Because of that, Wondershare Filmora may actually be deceptively simple – because it's capable of much more powerful features, if you take your time to study all its options, such as **picture in picture, green screen**, if you fancy yourself the next Hollywood director, adjustable playback speed, separation of the audio track from the original video file, tilt-shift effects, which can create very interesting results in a video, automatic noise reduction, and image enhancement, to bring back to life the subjects of the video, and automatic scene detection – allowing you to create a new video clip every time a scene changes. And there are a lot more things you can discover for yourself if you spend some time playing around.

Wondershare Filmora will also allow you to upload your creations directly to **Facebook or YouTube**, or to burn them on DVDs, so you can get straight into the next project without wasting any time.

### 2\. Video Maker for Mac: iMovie

iMovie is the proprietary software provided by Apple as part of its iLife suit. You may find it already installed on your Mac if you've just purchased a new machine. If not, it's free to use after you purchase iLife.

It's not the most powerful and complex application out there, as you can imagine for a piece of software that comes pre-installed, but it's a good first stop for people who are just starting out in this field and need to learn the basics of editing videos on Mac without too many headaches.

It has many easy-to-use effects and lots of build-in animations, music samples, and sounds to get you started on your first project immediately.

Granted, iMovie has sacrificed a lot of features for the simplicity of use – sooner or later you'll want to move on to something more complex, but, for beginners and for people who just need to add a few editing touches to a project here and there, this is a more than the reasonable solution. Don't let yourself put off by the fact iMovie has a rather bad reputation online – of course, that very advanced users are disappointed by it, but you can use it for a while and you'll know when it's time to move on.

### 3\. Video Maker on Mac: Blender

When you've exhausted the possibilities offered by iMovie and you need more power, Blender will be there, waiting for you. It's by far the most impressive of the free video makers for Mac – it's an open-source program, developed by the community – so it's always free to use, you won't stumble upon any hidden charges later on.

Like all open source applications, Blender is not the most intuitive at the first glance, but it more than compensates with the impressive range of features that bring it to the same level as a professional application. If you've been struggling to get everything just perfect before, now you'll have everything you need at your fingertips and you only need to unleash your imagination. It's 3D modeling options have been frequently compared to those that can only be found in applications that cost more than your Mac (maybe even more than your car, come to think of it).

Moreover, the community will always be there for you – if you have any questions or if you get stuck, you only need to post a question online and somebody will be there to help you out – not to mention the very large number of tutorials available online, with more being added almost daily.

If you're not sure about this, you may want to start by searching online for clips created entirely with Blender. Of course, yours won't be masterpieces from day one, it will take some time to get used to this application – but you'll get some idea of how powerful it can be, and the level of mastery that you'll want to achieve, eventually.

## From Clip to Cohesive: Mastering Color in FCP

# How to Easily Match Color in Video Clips with Final Cut Pro

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

 Aug 18, 2022• Proven solutions

If you are involved in video editing or post-production activities, then you might be familiar with color matching. In this, we make sure that the overall color and tone of our videos are matched throughout. Thankfully, you can easily do color match in Final Cut Pro or any other reliable video editing tool. In this detailed Final Cut Pro match color tutorial, I will help you do the same and would also share details about its best alternative.

## Part 1: How to Use Final Cut Pro X to Match Colors: A Stepwise Guide

Final Cut Pro X has to be one of the most resourceful Mac applications that you can use to edit your videos. If you want, you can use the automatic FCPX match color tool in the application to automatically apply the effect. Besides that, you can manually match color in Final Cut Pro X by using its inbuilt features.

**Method 1: Using the Final Cut Pro Match Color Tool**

To use the Final Cut Pro X Match Color feature, you can simply go through these simple steps:

_Step 1: Load and import the video clips_

To begin with, you can just launch Final Cut Pro on your Mac and go to its File > Import > Media to load any video clip of your choice. You can simply drag and drop your videos to the Final Cut Pro interface.

_Step 2: Apply the FCPX Match Color effect_

Now, simply select the clip you want to edit, go to the Enhancement menu, and click on the Match Color icon (below the viewer). You can also find it under the Modify > Match Color option or get the feature by pressing the Option + Command + M key combination.

Afterward, the Color Match FCPX tool will display two different screens in the viewer. On the right, you would have the clip from where you can match the source while the target clip will be displayed on the left.

From the Final Cut Pro timeline or the browser, you can find the appropriate clips. If you want, you can even import a still image to source the respective colors for matching. Simply preview the changes that the FCPX Color Match tool will make and click on the “Apply Match” in the end.

**Method 2: Adjust the Video Color Manually**

Apart from the match color tool in Final Cut, you can also manually set the color grading and saturation feature. While this will not get you instant or exact results to color match in Final Cut Pro, you can still give it a try.

Once the video clip is loaded on Filmora, just go to the Effects Browser > Inspector and add the Color Correction effect to the video. Now, you can go to the Color Correction tab from the sidebar to manually adjust the value for color, saturation, and exposure to get the desired effects.

## Part 2: Wondershare Filmora: The Best Alternative to FCPX Color Match Tool

Since Final Cut Pro is not the most user-friendly application, a lot of people look for other alternatives to perform operations like color match. Therefore, you can also take the assistance of [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is a powerful video editing and post-production tool that is extremely easy to use and runs on all the major macOS versions.

* On Filmora, you can find seamless options like color matching, color tuning, splitting, resizing, scene detection, and so on.
* There are also tons of advanced video editing features in Filmora like keyframing, motion detection, green screen edits, etc.
* You can find a wide range of effects, presets, texts, stickers, transitions, and more in the Filmora library.
* There are also dedicated options to edit audio in your media files or add voiceovers.
* Filmora is one of the easiest video editing tools out there with import/export options for all the leading formats.

To perform automatic color matching in your videos using Wondershare Filmora, the following steps can be taken:

_Step 1: Import the video to edit on Filmora_

At first, you can just launch Filmora on your Mac and drag-and-drop the video you want to edit. You can also go to its File > Import Media to load any video of your choice on Filmora and just drag the clips to the timeline (at the bottom).

_Step 2: Apply Color Correction to your Clips_

If you want, you can add multiple clips on Filmora and simply add them to the timeline as per your requirements.

You can now take the playhead and place it from where you wish to edit the video. You can select the remaining clip (or photos), right-click, and choose the Color Match option. Alternatively, you can also click on the color palette icon on the timeline’s toolbar and select the “Color Match” button.

This will change the viewer into two screens. Here, you can select the reference picture or clip as a source and preview its effects on the target clip. You can also go to the Color tab on the side and adjust its level under the Comparison View section.

On the viewer window, you can see all the changes, and click on the “Match” button to apply the effect.

_Step 3: Export your video to a preferred format_

After making the needed changes and applying the color correction feature, you can go to the Export option of the tool. Here, you can choose a preferred format to export your file and even choose its resolution and video quality.

I’m sure that after reading this post you would be able to apply color match in Final Cut Pro. As you can see, I have included a stepwise tutorial that anyone can follow to use the Final Cut Pro Match Color tool. Though, if you are looking for a better and more user-friendly option, then explore Wondershare Filmora. The free video editing application offers a wide range of features and will certainly meet every post-production need of yours in no time!

At first, you can just launch Filmora on your Mac and drag-and-drop the video you want to edit. You can also go to its File > Import Media to load any video of your choice on Filmora and just drag the clips to the timeline (at the bottom).

_Step 2: Apply Color Correction to your Clips_

If you want, you can add multiple clips on Filmora and simply add them to the timeline as per your requirements.

You can now take the playhead and place it from where you wish to edit the video. You can select the remaining clip (or photos), right-click, and choose the Color Match option. Alternatively, you can also click on the color palette icon on the timeline’s toolbar and select the “Color Match” button.

This will change the viewer into two screens. Here, you can select the reference picture or clip as a source and preview its effects on the target clip. You can also go to the Color tab on the side and adjust its level under the Comparison View section.

On the viewer window, you can see all the changes, and click on the “Match” button to apply the effect.

_Step 3: Export your video to a preferred format_

After making the needed changes and applying the color correction feature, you can go to the Export option of the tool. Here, you can choose a preferred format to export your file and even choose its resolution and video quality.

I’m sure that after reading this post you would be able to apply color match in Final Cut Pro. As you can see, I have included a stepwise tutorial that anyone can follow to use the Final Cut Pro Match Color tool. Though, if you are looking for a better and more user-friendly option, then explore Wondershare Filmora. The free video editing application offers a wide range of features and will certainly meet every post-production need of yours in no time!

#### 2. Video Editing

As we said before, Windows Live Movie Maker (later named Windows Movie Maker) is a simple and easy video editing software for Windows, it can complete some basic video editing and become a good choice for novices. Here, I will share with you about the basic video editing tutorial in the Movie Maker.

![Windows Movie Maker Edit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker-edit.jpg)

**Cut & Trim & Split video in Windows Movie Maker**

After adding videos and photos to the storyboard, you can now keep the useful sections and remove unwanted parts. To trim video, just place the playhead to the target position and right click the clip to select the Trim Set Start Point and move the playhead again to then end point and right click to select Set End Point. You can also go to the Edit tab and click the Split menu to split the video into parts. You can then delete and cut out unwanted sections or move it to the proper position.

**Add Audio to Video: Record and add voiceover or Music**

Windows Movie Maker also allows you to add narrations and background music to video footage. Just click the Add Music option and you can add music from online music libraries such as AudioMicro, Free Music Archive, and Vimeo or add music from the computer.

**Add auto movie themes to Video**

There is a built-in AutoMovie themes library in Movie Maker. You can use some popular themes such as Contemporary, Cinematic, Fade, Pan and Zoom, Black and White and Sepia.

**Add texts &titles to Video**

You can add titles, captions, and credits to video with windows movie maker, but it seems hard to add subtitles and customize its position. For more details about the text and title editing, check

Learn more details about [How to Add Text to Video with Windows Movie Maker](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Apply transitions & animations to video**

The Movie Maker features lots of transitions under Animations tab. You can choose from wipes, cinematics, shatters, sweeps and curls, patterns and shapes, reveals, diagonals and dissolves.

Note: if you use the default themes, you won’t see all these transitions. Check the detailed steps about [How to Add Transitions in Windows Movie Maker](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Apply visual effects to video**

We’ve introduced some of the best visual effects software before, but in Windows Movie Maker, you can also add effects such as 3D Ripple, Black and White, Blur, pixelate, mirrors, motions and fade effects.

**Change video speed of video**

The Movie Maker Edit tab allows you to adjust video volume, add fade in and fade out effects to video, or change video speed.
