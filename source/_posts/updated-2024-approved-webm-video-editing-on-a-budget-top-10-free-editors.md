The raw footage you record with your Smartphone or digital camera is not going to be saved in WebM file format.

Finding a [video editing app you can use for free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and that supports this video file format can be a daunting task. That is why we combed through the Internet in search of the **best free WebM video editors** you can use online or on your desktop computer. Here’s what we’ve come up with.

Editing videos on the Internet has its challenges, as most online video editors offer only a limited set of video editing tools. Even so, the video editing software products we featured in this article provide you with all the video editing options you are going to need to polish your WebM videos before posting them on social media or uploading them to your website. Let’s take a look at some of the best **online WebM video editors**.

## Part 1: 5 Best Online WebM Video Editors

The complexity of the video editing tasks you want to perform is the best way to determine which online WebM video editor you should use. So, if you would like to create WebM videos in a particular style then you should choose an [online video editing app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allows you to do much more than just trimming or resizing a video clip. Here are the five best online WebM video editors you can use for free.

#### 1\. [ClipChamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $9.00 per month

Before you can start editing a WebM video with Clipchamp, you must first set up an account. This online video editor already has more than 7 million registered users, which speaks volumes about its capabilities. You can choose from a broad range of fully customizable video templates that are optimized for use on different social networks and save you time on performing the video editing tasks on your own.

Clipchamp features impressive stock audio and video libraries you can use to create soundtracks or as a source of complementary footage for your WebM videos. The free version of this online video editor only lets you export videos in 480p resolution and you cannot use the stock footage for free.

#### 2\. [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $4.99 per month

This video editing platform offers a broad range of video editing options, so you will have very little trouble turning your footage saved in WebM format into attention-grabbing videos. The video editing tools you will have at your disposal depending on the subscription model you purchase.

With the Free version of WeVideo, you will only have five minutes of publishing time, you won’t be able to export WebM videos in resolutions larger than 480p and each video you create is going to be watermarked. That is why you must opt for Power, Unlimited, Professional or Business subscription package if you want your WebM videos to really stand out on social media.

#### 3\. [Magisto](https://www.magisto.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $4.99

Video content creators who post their videos on Instagram, Facebook or YouTube are going to love using Magisto. This web-based video editor is powered by AI that does all the video editing for you, which enables you to simply import the WebM videos you want to edit, select a video editing style and enjoy the results. In addition, you can choose from hundreds of customizable templates that can be used to promote a business or to create a Valentine’s Day video.

The duration of the videos you can create with Magisto depends on the subscription model you have, but even if you choose the most expensive version of Magisto you are still not going to be able to export videos that are longer than 10 minutes.

#### 4\. [Online UniConverter](https://www.media.io/video-editor.html)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $2.95 per month

Online UniConverter can be used to convert, compress or edit audio and video files for free, although your options are going to be limited if you opt for the free version of the web-based application. The free Video Editor enables you to perform basic video editing actions like trimming, cropping or rotating videos. In addition, you can adjust the Hue, Saturation or Brightness values of all WebM files you edit with Online UniConverter.

None of the videos you edit with this web-based video editor are going to be watermarked, but exporting videos in resolutions larger than 1080p isn’t an option.

#### 5\. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/)

**Price:** Free

Even though this is primarily a file conversion platform that enables you to change the format of images, PDF, audio or video files, you can also use Aconvert to edit your WebM videos. You can’t do much more other than cut, crop, rotate or merge video clips. In addition, you cannot upload video clips that are larger than 200MB to this platform which can make the video editing process difficult, since WebM videos can easily exceed this size limit.

Aconvert is far from being a perfect WebM video editor, but it still offers enough video editing options to enable you to create videos you can share online.

## Part 2: 5 Best Free Desktop WebM Video Editors

Desktop-based video editing software products are commonly much more powerful than those that can only be used online, which makes **editing WebM videos** somewhat easier. Here are some of the best desktop WebM video editors you can use for free on Mac or PC computers.

#### 1\. [VSDC](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

**Compatibility:** Windows XP or later

Editing WebM videos with VSDC isn’t any different than editing any other type of video since you just have to import a video into the editor, add it to the timeline and then remove all segments you don’t want to use. VSDC’s intuitive interface makes cutting, cropping or masking videos easy, as you can access any of these options with a single click. Moreover, the Video Stabilization tool enables you to turn shaky footage into perfectly smooth shots.

VSDC features a YouTube uploader and it lets you share your WebM videos to Facebook, Instagram or Vimeo. In addition, you can use this video editing software to change the format of your video files.

#### 2\. [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux

The support for a wide range of formats and a rich selection of video editing tools, make OpenShot an excellent choice for all video content creators who want to edit WebM videos. Besides the basic video editing options like resizing, cutting or trimming OpenShot is equipped with a title editor, an extensive library of visual effects and animation and keyframe options.

Each of these video editing tools can be used to make the footage saved in WebM format look more visually pleasing. Nonetheless, you are going to need at least basic video editing skills if you want to make the most of OpenShot’s video editing options.

#### 3\. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux

Besides being one of the most popular cross-platform media players ever created, VLC is also equipped with a set of video editing tools. In addition to converting WebM video files, you can also edit this type of file with VLC. This media player grants you access to a variety of filters, effects and color adjustment options you can use to polish your WebM videos.

Moreover, VLC lets you trim or crop each video you open with it so that you can remove the parts of the WebM videos you don’t want to share with your online audience. Even so, the process of editing a video with VLC can be too complicated for PC and Mac users who are not tech-savvy.

#### 5\. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/)

**Price:** Free

Even though this is primarily a file conversion platform that enables you to change the format of images, PDF, audio or video files, you can also use Aconvert to edit your WebM videos.

**What we like:**

It offers cloud storage

**What we don’t like:**

Some good features are paid and expensive

#### 5. [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)

**Price:** Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Windows and MacOS

Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.

Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.

**What we like:**

Complete video production tool with audio post-production options

**What we don’t like:**

4K video editing requires a premium version

#### 6. [VN Video Editor](https://www.vlognow.me/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS

Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.

Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.

You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.

So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.

**What we like:**

No watermark and easy to use

**What we don’t like**

No direct download link

Not meant for professional editors

#### 7. [VideoPad](https://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html)

**Price:**  Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Mac and Windows OS

Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.

In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.

Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.

**What we like:**

The free version includes lots of exciting features

Affordable upgrade

Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version

Additionally, you can [create titles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [apply visual effects and filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to video clips, or even record your own voiceovers. iMovie’s file sharing capabilities are perfectly suited for vlogging as you can upload a video to your YouTube channel or Facebook account directly from the software.

#### 4. [GoPro Quik Desktop app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows and MacOS

If you're traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.

**What we like:**

**What we don’t like:**

Some good features are paid and expensive

#### 5. [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)

**Price:** Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Windows and MacOS

Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.

Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.

**What we like:**

Complete video production tool with audio post-production options

**What we don’t like:**

4K video editing requires a premium version

#### 6. [VN Video Editor](https://www.vlognow.me/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS

Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.

Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.

You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.

So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.

**What we like:**

No watermark and easy to use

**What we don’t like**

No direct download link

Not meant for professional editors

#### 7. [VideoPad](https://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html)

**Price:**  Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Mac and Windows OS

Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.

In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.

Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.

**What we like:**

The free version includes lots of exciting features

Affordable upgrade

**What we don’t like:**

Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version

It features the drag-n-drop functions and offers almost all the classic video editing functions including trim, rotate, split, combine as well as adding music track, filters, and themes.

**What we like:**

Totally free for windows users and the automatic video creation feature is interesting

**What we don’t like:**

Video Editing Features are limited

Only for Windows users

#### 2. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** MacOS and iOS

iMovie is a free video editing software for vloggers who using Mac to edit vidoes. It is equipped with an array of fantastic and practical video editing features, iMovie is an idea video editing tool for anyone. Comes with every new iMac, it's free of charge and provides a wide range of effects and tools sets, thus it's always considered as an essential tool for any Mac user to enhance their vologs.

Despite a somewhat limited scope of video editing features iMovie provides, the software is still powerful enough to enable you to edit footage captured in resolutions up to **4K** . Additionally, you can [create titles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [apply visual effects and filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to video clips, or even record your own voiceovers. iMovie’s file sharing capabilities are perfectly suited for vlogging as you can upload a video to your YouTube channel or Facebook account directly from the software.

**What we like:**

#### 3. [VSDC Free Video Editor](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and[video file formats](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can **only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.**

**What we like:**

Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool

**What we don’t like:**

Sometimes errors appear when opening the software

#### 4. [GoPro Quik Desktop app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows and MacOS

If you're traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.

**What we like:**

It offers cloud storage

**What we don’t like:**

Some good features are paid and expensive

#### 5. [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)

**Price:** Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Windows and MacOS

Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.

Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.

**What we like:**

Complete video production tool with audio post-production options

**What we don’t like:**

4K video editing requires a premium version

#### 6. [VN Video Editor](https://www.vlognow.me/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS

Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.

Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.

You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.

So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.

**What we like:**

No watermark and easy to use

**What we don’t like**

No direct download link

Not meant for professional editors

#### 7. [VideoPad](https://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html)

**Price:**  Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Mac and Windows OS

Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.

In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.

Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.

**What we like:**

The free version includes lots of exciting features

Affordable upgrade

**What we don’t like:**

Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version

A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.

**What we like:**

Minor issues with clips splitting

The seemingly endless collection of tools, visual effects, and animation features will ensure that each video you edit in Adobe Premiere Pro meets the highest professional standards.

![Premiere Pro interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/premiere-pro-interface.jpg)

Vloggers in need of a powerful video editing app that is capable of performing even the most demanding video editing tasks will benefit from purchasing Adobe Premiere Pro as a single app or as a part of some other Creative Cloud plan.

It also supports many[third-party plug-ins](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for additional features.

A broad spectrum of video editing options grants you the creative freedom to visualize any idea, regardless of how complex that idea may be. However, if you are new to Final Cut Pro, you will   **need a lot of practice in order to be able to utilize its capabilities entirely.**

![final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/final-cut-pro-x.jpg "final cut pro")
