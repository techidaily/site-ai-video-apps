## Home video editing tips for better home movie making

 Make sure your videos have plenty of light and are not blurry. And be conscious of the background sound, and try to control it as much as possible. Besides, try to shoot scenes from different angles.

### 4\. Add video editing effects

 When you are editing your movies using some [video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can trim, split, rotate, split videos before or after using the PIP, Jump-cut, Face Off effects, but do not use too many transition effects.

 To make your home video more advanced, you can insert some still photos to the videos or use some advanced video effects such as [picture in picture effect in iMovie](/imovie/imovie-picture-in-picture.html). They will surely make you video more interesting.

### 6\. Don't make the home video too long

 Most home videos are long and boring. However, people usually don't like to see very trifle. So make your home video short, sweet and attractive. Get the best scenes and discard those trivial things.

### 7\. Get some humor
