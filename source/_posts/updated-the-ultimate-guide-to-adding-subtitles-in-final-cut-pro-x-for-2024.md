Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.

## Part 1: How to Add Subtitles/Captions in Final Cut Pro X?

Before you study the steps required to add subtitles to Final Cut Pro, here are some quick facts about the format of captions supported by FCPX.

* **ITT (iTunes Timed Text)**

It is required to deliver the contents of Caption to the iTunes store.

* **CEA-608 (SCC)**

It is a standard caption format for web videos and broadcasts.

* **SRT (SubRip)**

It is a simple and popular format used in online videos.

### Steps to Add Subtitles or Captions in FCPX

**Step 1: Create Caption Roles**

You need first to create caption roles to start adding captions to the timeline. Go to **Modify** \> **Edit Roles** and then select **Captions**. Then, select CEA-608, choose your language, and hit the Apply button.

**Step 2: Add Captions**

Position the playhead to where you have to set the Caption in the timeline. You need to hit the **Edit** tab and then select **Captions** \> **Add Caption**.

Select the drop-down menu across the language and select **CEA-608**.

Now, you can add captions in the preview window or the **Captions Text** given alongside.

Also, you can adjust the duration of the Caption by dragging it in the timeline.

**Step 3: Export a Caption Role**

Press **Command + E** or go to **File** \> **Export** to open the **Export** preview window. Now, you can select the name and save your video in standard export options. Hit the **Roles** tab given at the top.

Then, click the small **Captions** icon to reveal the menu. Select the subtitles or captions to import alongside the **Burn in Captions** tab. Hit the **OK** button and proceed with export as usual.

Thus, similar steps are required even if you want to add subtitles.

## Basic Video Editing Terms You Should Know

Below are some of the important yet basic terms that you should know related to videography in general and video editing in specific as well, whether you are a beginner or professional.

**Aspect ratio:**

The aspect ratio is the ratio of width and height of a video. Examples of the most used aspect ratios are: 4:3, 16:9, 1.85:1.

Refer to the image given below for a better understanding.

![aspec ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/aspec-ratio.jpg)

**B-roll:**

B-roll facilities one with the flexibility, when editing, to the video editing rules as it is an add-on picture that makes a previously incoherent scene seamless.

As shown in the image below, B-roll is used to insert which can make the transition easy to look on the eyes.

**Bit rate:**

Bit rate, also known as data rate, refers to the amount of data used for every second within the video. It is most commonly expressed in kilobits per second (kbps).

**Close up:**

Close-up refers to the shots that frame to subject tightly.

For instance, if it is a person, then the close-up covers solely his face.

**Color temperature:**

Color temperature refers to the light visibility in a shot. Color temperature is expressed in Kelvin. The scale of color temperature ranges from cool to warm.

![color temperature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/color-temperature.jpg)

**Composition:**

Composition entails the process of combining multiple footages using video editing software.

**Compression:**

Compression is the process of minimizing the quantity of data utilized in a video file. It helps make in the process of uploading and downloading quite faster. This also leaves you with ample space for more of your publications.

**Crop factor:**

Crop factor refers to a number that expresses the ratio of the imaging area of a sensor to a full-frame sensor. It typically ranges from 1.3 to 2.0.

**Cut-in**

Cut-in refers to showing a specific part of a subject in order to emphasize a certain aspect or emotion. For instance, hand gestures may show nervousness, enthusiasm, agitation, etc.

**Foley:**

Often times the original sound of the scene captured in the video is not captured as naturally as they were supposed to sound like in reality. Hence, Foley is when you reproduce those sounds for that video.

**Frame rate:**

Frame rate refers to the video capturing by a shutter in a second or shutter cycling rate through opening and closing. Some of the common frame rates are 24, 25, 29.97, 30, etc. The frame rate is expressed in frames per second (fps).

**High definition media interface:**

HDMI is the connectors that digitally transfer audio and HD video to a television. This is helpful if you intend to work on a bigger screen or wish to share some of your productions.

**Resolution:**

Resolution refers to the horizontal and vertical pixels of your video. For instance 640×480 for SD and 1280×720 for HD. Sometimes resolution refers only to the number of pixels that paper vertically. For example 480p, 720p, and 1080p respectively.

![resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resolution.jpg)

**J-Cut:**

J-cut refers to the editing technique in which the audio from a next scene is overlapped with the image from the previous scene, such that the audio segment of the next scene begins playing prior to its picture.

**Jumpcut:**

Jumpcut editing techniques refer to an abrupt transition between the two consecutive frames. The entity in the video containing jump cuts appears to jump along with the scene from one place to another. This looks disruptive to the audience.

**L-Cut:**

L-cut is exactly opposite to J-cut where the audio from the next scene overlays the image from the next scene to play the audio after an image has been displayed in the video.

**Lower third:**

As the name suggests, the lower third is derived from the rule of third which refers to the type of title, mostly used by vloggers, broadcasters, interviewers, and you tubers.

**Memory bank**:

You can understand the term by thinking of a memory box where we keep certain things as a memory of the events in someone’s life. Memory bank serves the same purpose through the use of video. It often uses natural sounds, document travel or merely store moments in routine life.

**Press kit:**

Press kit is used to provide information regarding your productions to the press for promotional purposes. Such information is often background including synopsis, crew, cast’s bios Q&A with the director, production stills and its reviews.

**Shot list:**

The shot list refers to the checklist related to the shots that a videographer plans to include in his/her content. This may help you save time and gear with efficient planning and handling. This gives a sense of direction to your production.

**Storyboard:**

A storyboard is a drawing to illustrate the scenes in the video. This gives a direct and organized way to visualize the needs for the shots or animation.

![storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/storyboard.jpg)

**Sync:**

Synchronization, aka sync, refers to the alignment of audio with video imaging.

**Rule of thirds:**

The rule of third is a grid that helps you to compose interesting and balanced shots to make your productions aesthetically pleasing. The grid is similar to a tic-tac-toe board since it segregates the picture into 9 segments. It helps bring points of interest to be aligned with the lines or intersection given in the grid.

![rule of thirds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/rule-of-thirds.jpg)

**Three-point lighting:**

This helps one to diminish the shadows for image balancing and provides an appealing contrast. These three lights are commonly known as fill, key, and backlight.

![three point lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/three-point-lighting.jpg)

**Tilts:**

Tilts refer to the vertical transitions that your camera. This is the opposite of pans.

![tilts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/tilts.jpg)

**Pans:**

Pans refer to the horizontal movements of your camera. This is exactly contrary to tilts.

**White balance:**

White balance refers to the process where the unrealistic color casts are removed in order to render a white object to be actually white in your photo, and not have other tints.

![white balance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/white-balance.jpg)

**Wide-angle:**

A wide-angel lens refers to a short focal length of a lens. This brings more of a subject rather than a subject being captured by a normal lens at equal distances.

![wide angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/wide-angle.jpg)

**Non-linear editing:**

NLEs is a non-destructive editing technique that allows one to access any frame in a video clip regardless of the sequence in the clip. It gives you the freedom to easily include effects, transitions, fades, etc. which cannot be achieved with linear editing

**Pixel aspect ratio:**

Pixels are several tiny squares that build up an image in a video. Whereas, aspect ratio refers to the ratio of width to height of a video. Hence, the pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the ratio of width to height of the pixels.

## Conclusion

Be it Instagram stories, YouTube product testimonials, or Facebook ads, using these easy-to-use video editing software will elevate your content into a professional and slick look.

So, I hope you are now ready to get started.

**Cut-in**

**L-Cut:**

L-cut is exactly opposite to J-cut where the audio from the next scene overlays the image from the next scene to play the audio after an image has been displayed in the video.

## Stop Motion in the Cloud: Tools, Tips, and Options

Creating a stop motion video is a fascinating process. If you use the right software and know the basics of making videos, you can create fantastic animations. While creating a stop motion video, there are things to keep in mind, like keeping the cameras steady and using the proper audio effects. Cloud Stop motion is well-known software with the tools to create unique video projects on your smartphone, laptop, desktop, Chromebook, or even tablet.

## Part 1\. Introduction- Cloud Stop Motion

It is easy to create stop motion animation with this web-based app. To use cloud stop motion you must first create an account and grant the app permission to your computer's webcam. Then you can start a new project and start taking pictures.

Each image is displayed on the timeline to know all photos that are going to be included in the stop motion video. On Cloud Stop Motion, you have the option to either record or import audio files from the sound library or your device. You can add additional things, like opening titles, end credits, speech bubbles, and text overlays. It functions directly in the browser on any modern device.

You do not have to install anything. It is all saved to the cloud. You can work with your animation on a zoomable, scrollable timeline.

Features -

* Easy to use, powerful, and intuitive software to create animations.
* The Interface has a modern design.
* It is equipped with a rich audio library, backgrounds and styles included.
* You can switch devices seamlessly at any point.

## Part 2\. How to Use Cloud Stop Motion to Create Animation Videos?

Cloud Stop Motion is a great browser-based app that one can use to create fun animation videos. You can use Cloud Stop Motion even when you have not created your account. But consider creating an account to enjoy additional features.

![cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Before you open Cloud Stop Motion and start clicking pictures of your subject for your video, it is important to have a story in mind. So, create a storyboard to break down your stop motion video. You can sketch your plan frame by frame or write bulleted list of your frames. It will help you create your project efficiently, ensuring that you have taken pictures of all the frames that you need to tell your story.

![adding new project on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-project-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Step 1: Once you have created your storyboard, open the app to go to the Cloud Stop Motion dashboard. Click on the new project button. Cloud Stop Motion needs access to your camera for capturing images. So, allow camera access.

![allowing access to camera on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/allowing-access-to-camera-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

On the dashboard, go to the taking picture menu. Now place the subject at the center of your frame. Capture a few test shots to find the composition that you like. You can see the picture at the bottom of the timeline. If needed, adjust the position of your subject. Make sure that the location you choose has plenty of light. If not, you also use a lamp for good light.

Tip: Keeping your phone or camera steady while making your stop-motion project is the key. You can use a tripod, a selfie stick, or a gimbal to keep your device as still as possible. If you don't own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.

Step 2: Move your subject or change its position and take a picture. Repeat the process until you complete your story. To make your stop-motion smooth, make small changes to the position of your subject between shots.

![capturing images on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/capturing-images-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

You can also add more frames per second. Generally, you should add 10 frames per second. But you can go for 25 frames per second to make a smoother video. All the pictures you snap are automatically added to the editor in chronological order.

Step 3: Once you have captured images for your project, add sound by going to the sound menu in the top left of the dashboard. You can record sounds, upload sounds, or select sounds from Cloud Stop Motion's gallery. You can also add text to your Cloud Stop Motion project if you want.

Step 4: Click on play button to preview your project and see if your motion picture turned out as per your liking or not. If you do not like something, go back and make changes. Once done, download your video from cloudstop motion.
