You don’t have to be a music prodigy to create an amazing music video, you don’t even have to know how to sing, because there are hundreds of iOS and Android-based apps that let you create a lip sync video. The only important thing is to move your lips and appear to be saying the same words at the exact same moment as the real singer of the song you’re covering. **Lip syncing** allows you to focus on your dancing or any other action you’re planning on doing in a video and reduces the need to perform a song perfectly.

**Lip sync videos** are a great source of fun, and producing them doesn’t require you to have a professional video or sound equipment. In this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the **best lip sync apps on iPhone and Android phones**, and we are going to show you **how to use them to create amazing lip sync videos**.

## Making Lip Sync Videos with 5 Best Lip Sync Apps

Lip syncing seems easier than it actually is because synchronizing the movement of your lips with the lyrics of a song can prove to be a challenging task. If the first take doesn’t turn out the way you wanted, keep trying because the practice is one of the most important aspects of creating a great lip sync video.

#### 1. TikTok

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/ro/app/tiktok/id835599320?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.android.ugc.trill&hl=en%5FUS)

In a little over two years, TikTok has become one of the largest platforms for music videos in the world after the acquisition of Musical.ly. Currently, the app **has over 150 million daily users** and the TikTok community keeps growing at an astounding rate. You can **browse through the latest videos** on the platform or **upload your own videos**.

The **+** icon located near the bottom of the screen grants you access to the **video recording** options. To access the TikTok’s library of songs you just have to tap on the **Pick a Sound** option and select the song you want to use in your video. As you tap on a song, a **Shoot with this sound** option will appear on the screen, tap on it to begin recording a video. The **scissors icon** can be used to **set the start and end points of a song**, while the menu near the bottom of the screen lets you choose **how fast the playback** of the song is going to be. Hit the **Record** button to start making your new lip sync video and once the recording session is over hit the **Post** icon to share the video on the TikTok platform.

#### 2. Triller

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.triller.droid&hl=en)

Tapping the Capture button will start the video recording session and while you’re recording you can zoom in or zoom out in order to change the composition of the shot. The app’s auto editing algorithm will render the video after you stop recording, but you can still add emojis, stickers or filters to each lip sync video you create with this app, by selecting the Re Edit option. The videos you produce with this app can be shared on all of the most popular social media or on the Triller platform

## Part 1: What to Consider When Choosing an Online Video Editor

Each video editor listed below has its distinct features. Here are the factors to consider when choosing an online video editor.

#### 1. Pricing

Whereas some online video editors are absolutely free, to others payment is a must to access no watermark option. It may be financially draining to subscribe to a $49.99/month plan. Then, why not opt for the $9.99/month if you have to?

It’s critically important to weigh your financial strengths. However, the features included in the paid plans and the video purpose determine how much to spend.

#### 2. Features

The attractiveness and video theme are better actualized by the features you use. Can you spot “no watermark” indicated anywhere within the features? Whether your edited videos will show with editor labels or watermarks is determined by the online video editor’s features.

Choosing an online video editor with cloud-based storage full of royalty-free videos and templates helps save time and simplifies editing procedures.

#### 3. Ease of Use

Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don't have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.

Before you can begin to use any video editor, consider evaluating the complexity of all features to use. How to import images and share edited videos to social media and websites should be given first priority during the evaluation process.

#### 4. Purpose of the Video

Creating and editing commercial videos require an online video editor with features designed with a business theme. You cannot choose an editor with watermarks and yet you are advertising a different product.

Tutorial videos are usually above 8 minutes and the voice should be as clear as possible. Some video editors and plans are limited to a 5-minute video.

## Part 1: What to Consider When Choosing an Online Video Editor

Each video editor listed below has its distinct features. Here are the factors to consider when choosing an online video editor.

#### 1. Pricing

Whereas some online video editors are absolutely free, to others payment is a must to access no watermark option. It may be financially draining to subscribe to a $49.99/month plan. Then, why not opt for the $9.99/month if you have to?

It’s critically important to weigh your financial strengths. However, the features included in the paid plans and the video purpose determine how much to spend.

#### 2. Features

The attractiveness and video theme are better actualized by the features you use. Can you spot “no watermark” indicated anywhere within the features? Whether your edited videos will show with editor labels or watermarks is determined by the online video editor’s features.

Choosing an online video editor with cloud-based storage full of royalty-free videos and templates helps save time and simplifies editing procedures.

#### 3. Ease of Use

Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don't have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.

Before you can begin to use any video editor, consider evaluating the complexity of all features to use. How to import images and share edited videos to social media and websites should be given first priority during the evaluation process.

#### 4. Purpose of the Video

Creating and editing commercial videos require an online video editor with features designed with a business theme. You cannot choose an editor with watermarks and yet you are advertising a different product.

Tutorial videos are usually above 8 minutes and the voice should be as clear as possible. Some video editors and plans are limited to a 5-minute video.

#### 3. Ease of Use

Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don't have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.
