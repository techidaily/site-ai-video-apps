Lastly, you can also use the ApowerSoft video editor as a video dubbing software as it has built-in features to record and edit audio.

* The tool is pretty easy to use and lets us record audio and perform different operations on it.
* You can drag and adjust the audio component to sync it with the picture.

* Apart from importing files of different formats, you can also export them in the format of your choice.

**Pros**

**Cons**

* Fewer features for audio editing.
* The premium version is paid.

**Conclusion:**

Now when you know six different video dubbing software for PC with free download options, you can easily pick up the best tool. While some are free applications, others only have a free demo version. You can explore the video dubbing software on your own and even try a few of them. I would recommend going with a multi-purpose tool like Filmora that will help you edit all kinds of videos and meet your post-production needs in one place.

**FAQ:**

1. Can I use Filmora to make high-quality changes to videos?

Filmora is an all-in-one video editor with many features and can do many things well. It makes professional video editing easy because it offers a user-friendly interface, drag-and-drop editing, and other complex video editing functions.

1. How well does Magix work?

Magix Movie Studio is an easy-to-use, stylish movie editor that doesn't cost too much. There are still some problems, like the reverse track order, but it's clear that this is a choice, and if you use other video editing programs, you'll get used to it.

1. Is Audacity good for the new learner?

Because it is so easy to use, Audacity is a great software for beginners who want to record and edit voices and recordings like a pro because it is so easy to use. Before we learn how to use Audacity step by step, let's look at some of the things that make it useful.

1. How long can Audacity record for?

Since Audacity stores samples as 64-bit values (even on 32-bit devices), there is no 32-bit rule that says recordings can't be longer than 231 samples (which is for example, just over 13.5 hours at a 44,100 Hz sample rate).

1. How do I change things in Apowersoft?

Use magic and fantasy to make your edits. To cut or crop a video file, click the scissors or cropping icon, depending on what you want to do. To join videos, drag files into the timeline in the order you want. Add filters and video overlay to your movie to make it look better.

Nowadays people tend to use high-resolution cameras in mobile devices instead of the old large video cameras to capture videos. But most of the time, you may fail to pay attention to the orientation of the video, thus the final recording is totally inverted. Don't worry!

Here are some easy-to-use tools (software and online solutions) that allow you to rotate, flip or turn your videos without hassle.
