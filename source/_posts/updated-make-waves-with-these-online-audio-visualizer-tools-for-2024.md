**●** You can only perform one conversion at a time

**●** You'd encounter several annoying advertisements while using the online application

**A YouTube tutorial about the audio conversion tool:**

### 06Zamzar

Zamzar Is one of the most popular online converting tools. It does not just have audio conversion features but also image conversion, video conversion and other files conversion. The tool is perfect for individuals who wish to convert their audio files just for a project. However, professionals who need to convert audio files often are not advised to use this platform. The user interface is pretty appealing and colourful and the zamzar convertor allows multiple conversions

**What We Like:**

**●** The tool is a one stop shop that allows you to convert multiple files

**●** The tool allows you to directly share the converted audio via mail. Hence, you needn't download the audio files

**●** The tool also has an online version if you wish to use it online

**What We Don't Like:**

**●** The tool limits it's free usage only to a 50 mb. Upon reaching the limit, you'd need to buy the paid version

**●** The download process is slightly tedious

**●** It does not have any editing options
