The purpose of today's article is to demonstrate that, with the correct video editor, you also can create slick, sophisticated video content—regardless of perception—and maintain your content marketing strategy ahead of the game.

In the coming year, [over half of marketers](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-content-videos) will add YouTube and Facebook platforms for streaming video; one-third of all internet usage is spent viewing video; video will make for more than 80% of all internet traffic by 2019\. 80% of the time! Let's get started! From the most affordable (i.e., free!) for the beginners. Here is the best **basic video editor** that includes the features you'll find handy in a video editor.

#### In this article

01 [ Best Basic Video Editors for Windows and Mac \[Free and Paid\] ](#part1)

02 [Best Free Basic Video Editors Online](#part2)

## Part 1: Best Basic Video Editors for Windows and Mac \[Free and Paid\]

What should you do when you do not have access to a video studio or a team of video experts on staff to film and edit your videos? Do not be concerned!

Without the need for an in-house team or outsourcing your video brand awareness, it's quicker than ever to make high-quality films on your own. Here are some of the top picks.

### 1\. Windows Photos App

Microsoft Photos, a free digital viewer and video editor included with Windows 10 and Windows 11, provides capable visual effects and video enhancements, as well as techniques for organizing and editing videos, everything in a touch-friendly functionality. Windows 10/11 comes with the Photos app pre-integrated. You don't have to do anything to obtain the app when you have Windows 10/11.

The free Microsoft photo and video editing app is a great choice for viewing, editing, and sharing digital photos and videos. As the name suggests, it's for Windows users – a delight to use a picture and video-editing tool that's simple to use, clean, and has all the functions you need for basic viewing and repairs. Obviously, a full-featured program like the Windows Photos App is required for advanced photo organizing, optimization, and effects.

![windows photos app interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-photos-app-interface.jpg)

Clips may be trimmed or divided, [text can be added](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), motion or 3D effects can be applied, filters can be used, and the [speed can be changed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It's a huge array that allows you to create an interesting result. There are over 20 options for [adding soundtracks](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at the backend at the top.

The Photos app features the Automatic Video tool which can [create video automatically with the images or videos uploaded](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### 2\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

Okay, so this one won't actually apply to those of you who deal with computers, but we'd be negligent if we left it off the roster. Thanks to its high-class interface, it doesn't get much nicer than Apple iMovie regarding elegance and beauty. It is only supported by macOS and iOS.

The ten [high-fidelity filters in iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are among the best in the video editing game, and you can utilize AirDrop to instantly and smoothly transmit your video to your Mac when you're filming on your iPhone or working on your iPad.

![imovie editing interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-editing-interface.jpg)

[Green-screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), or "chroma-key," is among iMovie's most prized tools since it enables you to relocate your characters to exotic locations—say, Hawaii—at any time. Do you want to add "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" to the image? Because iMovie is integrated with iTunes and GarageBand, you may quickly add unique music and sounds to your movie. Once your video is finished, send it out into the world via iMessage, Facebook, YouTube, or any of iMovie's numerous easily accessible venues.

Here are some tips and tricks in editing videos with iMovie, hope that will help you edit faster.

### 3\. [Apple Photos App](https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/)

Apple Photos, a free app included with macOS and iOS, is our pick for the best basic video editing software for Mac and iOS users because it embodies the company's concept of fun, easy-to-use software. The interface of Apple Photos is clean, straightforward, and direct, allowing you to express yourself using basic, uncomplicated shortcuts rather than the complex layers of capabilities seen in more feature-rich products. It is only supported by Apple devices only.

1. **Can I vlog with my phone?**

Yes, of course, you can vlog with your iPhone or Android phone. In recent days, most phones are equipped with a high-quality camera, and with the help of some camera shoot apps and video editing apps, you can totally record, edit and upload vlog videos on your phone.

1. **Which video editing software do vloggers use?**

There is no best for all. For vloggers in different stages, I recommend different editing software. For beginners who did not have any editing experience, I recommend you to try the pre-programmed video editing apps, such as Windows 10 Photos or iMovie. For those who are looking for a more powerful editor, I recommend Filmora because of its editing tools and plentiful effects and resources.

There is no doubt that Smartphone cameras can capture videos in breathtaking quality, but using a phone as a camera still has its challenges. The footage recorded with a Smartphone can often be shaky, especially if you’re shooting handheld or it can just contain parts that you don’t want to share with your followers on social media. In 2024, you can edit all videos immediately after you capture them, but in order to do that, you first need to discover a **vlog editor app**  that you really like using. That’s why we are going to take you through some of the best apps you can use to quickly edit your vlogs before you publish them on your iPhone or Android phones.

There are thousands of video editing software for Windows and Mac, Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) should be on the list since it provides all the basic editing tools that you need to edit a vlog video as well as plentiful pre-programmed video effects and templates and royalty-free music tracks and sound effects.

FAQs about Vlogging Apps

1. **What is the best app for vlogging?**

There are many video editing apps that you can use on both a mobile device or a desktop computer. If you’re editing vlog videos on iPhone, you can use the free built-in iMovie. If you are using Android to vlog, you can try Filmora. For vloggers who prefer to edit videos on a Windows or Mac computer, I recommend Filmora because of the resources and effects.

1. **Can I vlog with my phone?**

Yes, of course, you can vlog with your iPhone or Android phone. In recent days, most phones are equipped with a high-quality camera, and with the help of some camera shoot apps and video editing apps, you can totally record, edit and upload vlog videos on your phone.

1. **Which video editing software do vloggers use?**

There is no best for all. For vloggers in different stages, I recommend different editing software. For beginners who did not have any editing experience, I recommend you to try the pre-programmed video editing apps, such as Windows 10 Photos or iMovie. For those who are looking for a more powerful editor, I recommend Filmora because of its editing tools and plentiful effects and resources.

There is no doubt that Smartphone cameras can capture videos in breathtaking quality, but using a phone as a camera still has its challenges. The footage recorded with a Smartphone can often be shaky, especially if you’re shooting handheld or it can just contain parts that you don’t want to share with your followers on social media. In 2024, you can edit all videos immediately after you capture them, but in order to do that, you first need to discover a **vlog editor app**  that you really like using. That’s why we are going to take you through some of the best apps you can use to quickly edit your vlogs before you publish them on your iPhone or Android phones.

There are thousands of video editing software for Windows and Mac, Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) should be on the list since it provides all the basic editing tools that you need to edit a vlog video as well as plentiful pre-programmed video effects and templates and royalty-free music tracks and sound effects.
