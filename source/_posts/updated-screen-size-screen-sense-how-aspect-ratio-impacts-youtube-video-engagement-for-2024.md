It is must to know thing that video which you are posting must be in the actual and same frame rate in which it has been recorded. The most common frame rates for YouTube videos are 24, 48, 30, 25 and 60\. However you can post the videos in any other frame rate but these are recommended the most.

It is equally important to deinterlace the content before you are posting it. This means if your video has 1080i60p and you want to convert it into 1080i30p then you will need to change the frame rate first.

## Part 2 How to Make Your Videos Look Their Best?

### 01The Right YouTube Dimensions

You can upload videos of so many different dimensions and sizes. These start from 240P to 2160P. The smallest dimension of YouTube videos is 426 by 240 pixels. However, the largest dimensions may go till 3840 by 2160 pixels. YouTube allows all the video dimensions between these ranges. The most accurate YouTube dimension is 1920 by 1080 pixels. The guidelines that are followed on YouTube videos are pretty clear. You can get the quality of 4K if you go for the highest dimension and the quality decreases as you decrease the dimension of your video.

### 02Ways to Change YouTube Video Sizes

As a YouTube user, you have the option to change the video sizes and resolution so that you can get a vivid viewing experience of your videos. This may also boost the audience number on your videos. To change the video size of YouTube, you will just need to follow some simple steps that are mentioned here:

**Step 1:** First of all, you will have to open the video whose size you want to change. After this you will have to open the setting option from the icons that are displayed below the video.

**Step 2:** After opening the settings icon, you will find the option of quality. Choose that option and there you will see a list of dimensions amongst which you have to choose the one in which you wish to put your video. For example it may be 720p or less and more.

**Step 3:** As soon you choose the dimension or resolution the next step you have to do is go for it and click on save option and your video size is changed.

### 03How to Record YouTube Videos with the Right Dimensions

This will look professional as well as will boost your video quality too. Also it is worth considering that the video dimensions matter a lot when you are creating the videos. Do consider the device that you are using to create the video as many devices can create the videos in the highest resolution possible.

 You must also know that videos with higher dimension and resolution need more space so before making the videos do have a check on your storage space too. It is also a good idea to maintain the balance between high quality videos and your storage space.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Finding a good video maker for Mac is not always easy – not for lack of options, there are many applications out there, but there are **two main limitations**: money, first and foremost, we all know how expensive video makers – good video makers – can be. The second limitation is complexity: sometimes you end up spending more time reading the help instead of editing, and the application you've chosen probably contains the features that you need – except that you have serious problems finding them on the menu.

[1\. Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac](#part1)  
[2\. iMovie](#part2)  
[3\. Blender](#part3)

## Best Video Maker for Mac

Some video makers manage to stay on top by avoiding, or at least limiting these problems, and here are three of those.

### 1.Vieo Maker on Mac: [Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora for Mac offers perhaps the best value for money (not to mention that it has a free version as well if you'd like to try it first. It supports pretty much any format you may think of (AVI, MP4, MOV, MPG, MKV, TRP, and so on), and it's quite easy to use when it comes to the most basic features you'd expect in a video editor, such as cropping, joining, trimming, and rotating, as well as for adding some effects, transitions, and sound effects.

Because of that, Wondershare Filmora may actually be deceptively simple – because it's capable of much more powerful features, if you take your time to study all its options, such as **picture in picture, green screen**, if you fancy yourself the next Hollywood director, adjustable playback speed, separation of the audio track from the original video file, tilt-shift effects, which can create very interesting results in a video, automatic noise reduction, and image enhancement, to bring back to life the subjects of the video, and automatic scene detection – allowing you to create a new video clip every time a scene changes. And there are a lot more things you can discover for yourself if you spend some time playing around.

Wondershare Filmora will also allow you to upload your creations directly to **Facebook or YouTube**, or to burn them on DVDs, so you can get straight into the next project without wasting any time.

### 2\. Video Maker for Mac: iMovie

iMovie is the proprietary software provided by Apple as part of its iLife suit. You may find it already installed on your Mac if you've just purchased a new machine. If not, it's free to use after you purchase iLife.

It's not the most powerful and complex application out there, as you can imagine for a piece of software that comes pre-installed, but it's a good first stop for people who are just starting out in this field and need to learn the basics of editing videos on Mac without too many headaches.

It has many easy-to-use effects and lots of build-in animations, music samples, and sounds to get you started on your first project immediately.

Granted, iMovie has sacrificed a lot of features for the simplicity of use – sooner or later you'll want to move on to something more complex, but, for beginners and for people who just need to add a few editing touches to a project here and there, this is a more than the reasonable solution. Don't let yourself put off by the fact iMovie has a rather bad reputation online – of course, that very advanced users are disappointed by it, but you can use it for a while and you'll know when it's time to move on.

### 3\. Video Maker on Mac: Blender

When you've exhausted the possibilities offered by iMovie and you need more power, Blender will be there, waiting for you. It's by far the most impressive of the free video makers for Mac – it's an open-source program, developed by the community – so it's always free to use, you won't stumble upon any hidden charges later on.

Like all open source applications, Blender is not the most intuitive at the first glance, but it more than compensates with the impressive range of features that bring it to the same level as a professional application. If you've been struggling to get everything just perfect before, now you'll have everything you need at your fingertips and you only need to unleash your imagination. It's 3D modeling options have been frequently compared to those that can only be found in applications that cost more than your Mac (maybe even more than your car, come to think of it).

Moreover, the community will always be there for you – if you have any questions or if you get stuck, you only need to post a question online and somebody will be there to help you out – not to mention the very large number of tutorials available online, with more being added almost daily.

If you're not sure about this, you may want to start by searching online for clips created entirely with Blender. Of course, yours won't be masterpieces from day one, it will take some time to get used to this application – but you'll get some idea of how powerful it can be, and the level of mastery that you'll want to achieve, eventually.

This format can be used by anyone with the right skills and knowledge. Additionally, file formats like this can contain not only the audio data but also video, text (like subtitles), and metadata related to the audio.
