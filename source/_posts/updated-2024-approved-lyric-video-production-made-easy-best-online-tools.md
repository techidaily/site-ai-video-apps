Though the site chooses the first frame of the video as the thumbnail, you can even set a customized one that is attractive and interesting.

The **LinkedIn video thumbnail size** specifications are as follows:

**●** Image size: 1200 X 627 pixels

**●** Format of the image: JPG or PNG

**●** Maximum size of the image: 2MB

**●** Aspect Ratio: The aspect ratio of the thumbnail should match that of the video itself.

## Part 2 Publishing videos on LinkedIn

If you are planning to publish a video on LinkedIn, the first thing to know is the place where it will be published. LinkedIn allows adding the videos on the personal feed as well as on the Company pages.

If you are into an established business or a brand having a large number of followers, paid video posts on the company page work best.

For the small- setups and businesses who are looking to promote their products and brands posting a video on the personal feed is a good idea. Initially, you can start by posting on your feed and then can later create a company page.

## Part 3 Ways To Publish Videos On Linkedin

After you have decided that whether you will be posting a video on your company page or your personal feed, the next thing is to decide that how the video will be published. There are 3 different ways for posting a video as enlisted below.

**●** **Using YouTube and Vimeo links**

If you have your videos on Vimeo or YouTube you can paste their link on your LinkedIn account. To watch the video, a person needs to click on the link and it will then open in the hosting platform.

**●** **Using LinkedIn Native Video**

This is the most effective method where a video can be uploaded directly on your LinkedIn account from your system as well as your phone. While posting videos directly on LinkedIn, you can even add customized thumbnails, stickers, subtitles, and titles. A native video will play automatically as it is seen by the people in their feed and thus, they reach a larger number of people.

**●** **Using LinkedIn video ads**

To reach the target audience, a sponsored post is also an effective way and the video ads can be posted only through a company page. Depending on the type of product or the brand to be promoted, the video can be created.

## Part 4 Importance Of Thumbnails In Linkedin Video

The LinkedIn video thumbnail is one of the important factors that make your video engaging and interesting. Before a person starts watching your video, you need to ensure that they get interested in it and click it. For grabbing this first-time attention, a custom thumbnail works great. You can use any interesting graphic or an image related to your video and edit it to create a customized thumbnail.

A thumbnail can only be used when videos are posted as native LinkedIn videos.

#### 4. JoinHoney

This website is run by Honey Science Corp which is headquartered in Los Angeles. It operates the site as a browser extension. This then aggregates different coupon deals from different eCommerce sites. A site is a subsidiary unit of PayPal. This retailer gains commission by redirecting customers to partner retailer sites.

Unlike most coupon websites this site adds an extension to your web browser. It is a free application that you can simply add as an extension to Chrome or any other browser application. You can then look up codes of a variety of services and products on select websites through this extension bar. It also helps you find codes across 3000 and more websites.

* Easy to install.
* No need to pay the subscription fee.
* Supports multiple products and stores.
* Not marketed well.

#### 5. CouponFollow

This is an online platform that features coupon codes for online merchants. It is part of a venture formed in 2009 by Marc Mezzacca. Also, the website is headquartered in New Jersey. This site, formed in 2009, earns commission when customers click and follow links to complete transactions on partner sites. If you are looking for the latest Filmora coupon code Reddit it is best to use the search function here.

* CouponFollow provides an easy-to-use web interface.
* Reliable customer service.
* Dependable website.

**Conclusion**

There are different discount deals to use to get off on Filmora subscription plans. If you wish to make the most of the latest offers, log onto sites such as the coupon websites mentioned above instead of the Filmora coupon code Reddit. They will redirect you to the official website where you can avail of the discount when purchasing a subscription plan as per your requirement.
