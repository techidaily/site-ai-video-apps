I confess I'm a keyboard shortcut junkie. Anything I can do to help me edit faster is a good thing, and nothing says "speed" like keyboard shortcuts. There are well over 600 menu options in FCP X, with hundreds of keyboard shortcuts. But, which ones are the best?

In this article, I share my Top 40 keyboard shortcuts. I use these beauties every day to help me get my projects done faster. Now, you can use them, too. Even better, I've categorized them to make them easier to find. Haven't got FCPX yet? [Get your 90-day free trial here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

(And, for those who take the time to count, you'll discover this list actually includes 53 keyboard shortcuts. But using "Top 40" in the title seemed so much sexier than "Top 53.")

I confess I'm a keyboard shortcut junkie. Anything I can do to help me edit faster is a good thing, and nothing says "speed" like keyboard shortcuts. There are well over 600 menu options in FCP X, with hundreds of keyboard shortcuts. But, which ones are the best?

In this article, I share my Top 40 keyboard shortcuts. I use these beauties every day to help me get my projects done faster. Now, you can use them, too. Even better, I've categorized them to make them easier to find. Haven't got FCPX yet? [Get your 90-day free trial here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

(And, for those who take the time to count, you'll discover this list actually includes 53 keyboard shortcuts. But using "Top 40" in the title seemed so much sexier than "Top 53.")

## FAQ

* **What to do when the shortcuts in FCPX not working?**

Change your input source of keyboard set to US should fix the problem.

* **How to modify shortcuts in FCPX?**

There are two ways to open the modifying menu: choose Final Cut Pro > Commands > Customize, or press Option-Command-K. Then, change the shortcuts and save.
