01 [What is Video Stabilization?](#part1)

02 [Best Video Stabilizer Apps for iPhone and Android](#part2)

03 [What Features Should I Look for in a Video Stabilizer App?](#part3)

## Part 1: What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization refers to algorithms that remove undesirable camera tremors and jitters caused by hand jiggling and the unintended camera panning to improve video quality.

Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image/video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.

Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.

It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie's transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.

## Part 2: Best Video Stabilizer Apps for iPhone and Android

Here are the best video stabilizer apps for iPhone and Android for you to choose from.

### 1\. [Emulsio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-stabilizer-emulsio-3/id397583851)

Overall, this app provides accurate control as well as previewing capabilities. It offers time-editing capabilities as well as live comparison capabilities. Finally, you may send altered films by email or social media. However, if you want to remove the watermark, you need to pay.

Using Emulsio to stabilize video on iPhone is easy, all you need to do is importing the video to analyse, and the app will analyse the video for you automatically. After analysing, the video will be stabilized accordingly, and you can then modify it based on your needs.

Emulsio also provides some additional settings, such as stabilization profile, rolling shutter, avoid black borders, and discontinuity handling to improve the stabilization result.

## Part 1: What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization refers to algorithms that remove undesirable camera tremors and jitters caused by hand jiggling and the unintended camera panning to improve video quality.

Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image/video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.

Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.

It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie's transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.
