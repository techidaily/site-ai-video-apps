## Part 2: How to Add 3D Effects to Video with Filmora

Although Photos is a free app in Windows 11, it has certain limitations. This is where [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a product by Wondershare, comes into play. Wondershare Filmora is a post-production application for both Windows and Mac computers, and is considered a good competitor of some of the industry-standard video editing applications like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X, DaVinci Resolve, etc.

While the Photos app can add 3D effects to the videos quickly, Filmora gives more control by offering a plethora of editing tools, options, and presets. In addition, Filmora is a timeline-oriented tool that allows you to add effects, filters, and/or elements in their corresponding layers without making any changes to the original footage.

You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:

**Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline**

After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the **+** icon from the bottom-right corner.

When the confirmation box appears, either click **Match to Media** or **Keep Project Settings** to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.

**Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions**

Click **Titles** from the toolbox at the top, type **3D Titles** in the **Search titles** field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click **3D titles** from the suggestions list.

![find 3d title effects filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-3d-title-effects-filmora.jpg)

From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.

![add 3d title effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-title-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

After this, double-click the placeholder text in the **Preview** window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click **OK** from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.

To add the transitions, click **Media** from the toolbox at the top, click **Import Media** from the **Media** box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other.

Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.

![add 3d transition effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-transition-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

After this, move the **Playhead** (**Skimmer**) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the **Spacebar** on your keyboard to preview the video.

**Note:** It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.

**Step 3: Add Elements and Effects**

Go to **Elements** from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.

As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the **Effects** layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.

**Note:** The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.

![add 3d effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

## Part 2: How to Add 3D Effects to Video with Filmora

Although Photos is a free app in Windows 11, it has certain limitations. This is where [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a product by Wondershare, comes into play. Wondershare Filmora is a post-production application for both Windows and Mac computers, and is considered a good competitor of some of the industry-standard video editing applications like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X, DaVinci Resolve, etc.

While the Photos app can add 3D effects to the videos quickly, Filmora gives more control by offering a plethora of editing tools, options, and presets. In addition, Filmora is a timeline-oriented tool that allows you to add effects, filters, and/or elements in their corresponding layers without making any changes to the original footage.

For macOS 10.12 or later

You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:

**Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline**

After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the **+** icon from the bottom-right corner.

When the confirmation box appears, either click **Match to Media** or **Keep Project Settings** to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.

**Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions**

Click **Titles** from the toolbox at the top, type **3D Titles** in the **Search titles** field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click **3D titles** from the suggestions list.

![find 3d title effects filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-3d-title-effects-filmora.jpg)

From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.

![add 3d title effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-title-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

After this, double-click the placeholder text in the **Preview** window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click **OK** from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.

![edit 3d title effects in video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-3d-title-effects-in-video-filmora.jpg)

To add the transitions, click **Media** from the toolbox at the top, click **Import Media** from the **Media** box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to **Transitions** from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.

![add 3d transition effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-transition-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

After this, move the **Playhead** (**Skimmer**) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the **Spacebar** on your keyboard to preview the video.

**Note:** It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.

**Step 3: Add Elements and Effects**

Go to **Elements** from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.

![add 3d elements to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-elements-to-video-filmora.jpg)

To add effects, go to **Effects** from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the **Effects** layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.

**Note:** The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.

![add 3d effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

Once this is done, preview the video, click **Export** from the top-center, and use the tabs and options on the **Export** box to export the modified video in your preferred format.

**Conclusion**

If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.

Now, is there any Premiere transition you like? If you have picked one, now let's to add it to Premiere Pro. Here are few easy to follow steps for your Premiere Pro transition effects.

### Step 1: Go to Effects panel

The types of numbers of transitions available in effects panel will depend upon the version of Premiere Pro that you have installed in your system. Some of the most common transition effects are listed below:

* **Zoom:** Zoom transition helps to work on a selected potion of screen and it brings scene in or out in a selected proportion from whole screen.
* **Slide:** In this sliding motion type transition effect, one scene floats over another.
* **Wipe:** This one is quite interesting where one shot complete replaces the selected another shot while travelling from one portion of the frame to another.
* **Iris:** The iris transition effect is a newer one where an artificial effect is created to reflect the actual opening and closing motion of camera iris during shooting.
* **3D Motion:** Such type of transition effects tries to manipulate selected clips in the space. For instance, if you apply flip over transition in this 3D motion category then one clip will simply flip over screen in such a manner that secondary clip below it gets revealed in appealing manner.
* **Dissolve:** In this type of transition effect, one scene completely melds into another scene. You can describe such type of blends with terms like fade out and fade in from or to a bank image.

Effects folders usually contain stylistically similar kind of transitions, but the result different appearances are on screen.
