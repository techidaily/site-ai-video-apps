There are two broad categories of effects in Final Cut Pro X: Inspector effects and Effects Browser effects.

I've written previously about how to use Inspector effects to create a [picture-in-picture](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) effect, among many other effects available to us in Final Cut Pro. In this article, I want to show you how to apply an effect to a clip, modify that effect, temporarily turn that effect on or off, or delete it entirely.

---

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## How to Apply Effects to Video in Final Cut Pro X

* [Find and apply an effect](#part1)
* [Modify an effect](#part2)
* [Disable and delete an effect](#part3)
* [Extra credit](#part4)

#### Find and apply an effect

Here is our clip - a fearsome polar bear.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx001.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To apply an effect, first select the clip in the Timeline.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx002.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Then, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Effects Browser (or type Cmd + 5).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx003.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The Browser, like all the effects browsers, lists categories of effects on the left, a search box at the bottom to use for searching for the names of effects, and effects for each category on the right.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx004.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Here, for example, I've selected the Blur category, with my cursor near the Gaussian blur effect. (Gaussian blur is the best effect to use when you want a clip to look blurry.)

To apply an effect, do one of two things:

* Drag the effect from the Browser onto the clip you want to change.
* If the clip, or clips, are selected, double-click the effect in the Browser to apply it.

#### Modify an effect

To modify an effect, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Inspector (or type Cmd + 4).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx005.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Click the Video tab in the Inspector. Effects from the Effects Browser are always listed at the top of the Inspector.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx006.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Grab a slider and drag it to see what happens. For example, to make an image blurrier, drag the Amount slider to the right. To lessen the effect, drag it to the left.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx007.jpg "add effects in fcp")

#### Disable and delete an effect

To temporarily disable an effect, without deleting it, click the blue box so that it turns gray.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx008.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To enable an effect, click the gray box so it turns blue again.

To delete an effect, click the name of the effect - in this example: Gaussian - and press the big Delete key.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx009.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The effect will be deleted from the selected clip.

#### Extra credit

You can apply, modify, even delete the same effect to multiple clips by first selecting all the clips you want to change in the Timeline then adding, changing the settings, or deleting an effect in the Inspector.

#### Summary

The process of applying effects is the same for all effects you apply from the Effects Browser. In future articles I'll show you how to use this technique to create a wide variety of different effects in Final Cut Pro X.

Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame.

Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.

Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.

**●** Use eye-catchy titles: Using catchy titles in your thumbnails is an effective way to grab the attention of the viewers. A title will give a glimpse to the viewers of the content of the video.

**●** Try different designs: If you are not sure about a thumbnail design, create multiple ones and then add them to the video one by one. Select the design that goes best and looks attractive.

## Part 4 How to Add A Customized Thumbnail To A Youtube Video

Once a customized thumbnail image is created, the next step is to add it to the video on your YouTube. The process is simple and quick and involves the following steps.

Step 1\. Open your YouTube account and add the new video using the camera-plus icon. Alternatively, to add a thumbnail to the already uploaded video, go to the Studio dashboard and tap on the video for editing the settings.

Step 2\. At the bottom of the video settings window, you can see the 3 thumbnails generated automatically. To upload the customized image, click on the Custom thumbnail box at the bottom right-hand side.

Step 3\. Browse and import the created thumbnail image and click on the Upload button.

The selected image will not be used as the thumbnail for the video.
