The Glitch Art movement is gaining a lot of attention on social media, as the photos and videos that contain glitches gather thousands of views and likes. Some video editing software products don’t have preset glitch effects, and creating this effect from scratch can be a time-consuming task.

Online glitch effect generators enable you to add glitch effects to both photos and videos even if you have no previous video editing experience, which makes them a great option for all social media content creators who want to go through the editing process as quickly as possible. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best free online glitch effect generators you can use to edit photos and videos.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5. ImageGlitcher

You shouldn’t expect great results from this online glitch generator, as the website is poorly designed and it offers only a few basic glitch adjustment options. The size of the photo you upload to the website has an impact on how it is going to be displayed, which means that photos in large resolutions may be difficult to preview.

![ImageGlitcher](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airtightinteractive-image-glitcher.jpg)

Furthermore, you can only adjust Glitchiness and Brightness options, while you can also toggle the Scan Line option on and off. You can’t do much else with ImageGlitcher, not even share your creations on social media. Applying the glitch effect to a photo may take a while, and the website might crash in the process. That’s why you shouldn’t use ImageGlitcher unless it is your only option to glitch a photo.

**Pros**

* It is free
* Support images saved in JPEG format

**Cons**

* Website crashes easily
* Only basic glitch effect settings
* Poorly designed and difficult to navigate
* Only works with photos that have resolution lower than 1024x1024

### 6. Image Glitch Tool

Image Glitch Tool is a simple glitch effect generator that allows you to upload a photo and adjust the effect’s settings quickly. The photo you upload to this platform is going to be displayed in the Preview Window, and the platform will also resize the photo automatically in case it exceeds its size limitations to avoid errors.

![Image Glitch Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jpg-glitch.jpg)

What’s more, Image Glitch Tool enables you to take photos with a webcam and apply glitch effect to them just moments after you captured them. The Amount, Seed, Iterations, and Quality sliders allow you to fine-tune the glitch effect so that it fits the image you are editing. However, creating a text overlay with this online glitch generator is not possible as you can only use it to apply the glitch effect to photos.

**Pros**

* Intuitive and functional design
* Allows users to take photos with a webcam
* Photos are adjusted automatically to the platform’s size requirements
* All photos can be uploaded to Imgur directly from Image Glitch Tool

**Cons**

* Doesn’t support video files
* Offers just one glitch effect

### 7. Mara

Mara is an online photo editing platform that lets its users crop photos, create image overlays, sharpen images, and much more. Its Glitcher feature provides an easy way to apply a glitch effect to a photo. You can upload a photo from your computer, via an URL or from Dropbox.

![Mara Glitcher](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mara-photos-glitcher.jpg)

The photo will open in the Glitcher window as soon as you upload it, so you can use the Seed, Amount, Iterations, and Quality sliders to create a glitch effect. In addition, you can transfer the photo you’re editing with the Glitcher tool to other tools Mara photo editing platform offers and use them to polish the photo to which you applied the glitch effect. Besides saving the photo to your computer, you can also share it to Facebook and other social media platforms.

**Pros**

* Powerful glitch tool
* Customizing the glitch effect is easy and fun
* Mara is equipped with a broad range of photo editing tools
* Excellent social sharing options

**Cons**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 8. HTML5 Image Glitcher

You don’t need a lot of photo editing experience in order to create a glitch effect with this tool. Before you upload a photo, you should decide if you want to keep the file’s actual size or resize it to a lower resolution. Also, this tool lets you choose if you want to create a JPEG, PNG, or WEBP file.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![HTML5 Image Glitcher](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/html5-image-glitcher.jpg)

Once you’ve adjusted these settings you can proceed to select how damaged the photo is going to be, and you should pick the 1-hit option if you want the damage to be minimal or 1000-hits option if you want the damage to be severe. The results will be displayed in the Preview Window immediately so that you can adjust this setting accordingly. You can save the photo you created by either clicking on Download JPEG or Download PNG file.

**Pros**

* Users can choose the resolution of the photos they upload
* The glitch effect generator is easy to use
* Adjusting the intensity of the glitch effect is easy
* Supports all common picture file formats

**Cons**

* No social sharing options
* Offers only basic glitch effect settings
