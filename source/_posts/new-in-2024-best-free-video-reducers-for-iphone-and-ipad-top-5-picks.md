Video Compressor app makes shrinking videos look easy because it **offers a number of presets** that let you choose how much you want to reduce the size of a video. Besides saving time this free video compressor for iPhones and iPads can create more storage space on your device.

#### How to shrink video size with this app?

Select a video you want to compress, by simply tapping on it, and then **choose a preset resolution** to which that video clip is going to be compressed. Optionally, you can **change the Bitrate** before tapping on the Compression button.

After the video compression process is over you can organize the shrunk videos effortlessly, however, you **must purchase the Pro version** of the app if you want to have access to all of the tools Video Compressor has to offer.

## Is there any iPhone free video compressor with editor built in?

Editing a video before you share it on social media can help you get rid of unwanted parts and make the colors more vivid. **iMovie** is an excellent choice if you would like to **trim a video or add filters and effects to it and reduce the video size**. What’s more, you can use this iOS-native video editing app to reduce the size of the original video files.

After you pick a preferred output resolution the iMovie is going to add the video to the Photo Library.

## Bonus: How to reduce video size on iPhone & iPad when recording?

All recent iPhone and iPad models support recording in a broad spectrum of video resolutions. If you would like to **decrease the resolution** at which your device captures videos you should head to the **Settings menu** and tap on the Camera option.

![change video size at shooting on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-size-at-shooting-iphone.jpg)

Select **Record Video** from the Camera menu and then choose the new resolution for your videos. The default resolution is set at 1080p at 30fps, but you can easily reduce it to 720p at 30fps if you want to create videos that don’t take too much storage space.

The **Record Slo-Mo option** lets you choose between 720p HD at 120fps or 720p HD at 240 fps which allows you to preserve storage space while recording high-quality slow-motion videos.

**Conclusion**

Videos recorded with iPhones and iPads can be huge in size, and sending them or uploading them to the Internet can be a time-consuming process. Installing a free video compressing app for iOS can be a good idea if you record videos with your iPhone or iPad often. Each of the free video compressor apps we included in this article can shrink videos quickly and efficiently. Which free video compressor app are you going to choose?
