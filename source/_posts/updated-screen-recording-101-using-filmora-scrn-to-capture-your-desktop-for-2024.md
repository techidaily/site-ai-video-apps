## How to record desktop with Filmora Scrn

#### Step 1 – Get the Program on Your PC

Initially, Download it and install it. After completing all installation formalities, launch Filmora Scrn on your computer.

#### Step 2 – Go for the Appropriate Option

Now, the main interface will provide you three options which are "Get Started", "Quick Capture" and "Video Editor".

**Get Started** – If you wish to hit on this tab, you will be brought up to a new interface where you can customize the recording parameters according to your preferences.

For instance, customizing audio settings or adjusting the recording area, frame rate, or also to set recording source as webcam (if you need) along with recording your desktop screen.

**Quick Capture** – If you prefer to record your desktop with the default settings, you should then hit on this tab to immediately launch the capturing console.

**Video Editor** – This tab is specifically for the video lovers who wish to edit and enhance their videos by adding annotation effects, cursor effects or by doing some basic video editing (crop, split, resize, rotate and more).

Hit the one that suits you, in this case, hit on "Get Started".

#### Step 3 – Customizing Record Settings

Right after pushing the "Get Started" tab, the "Setup" interface will load up. You will now have 4 different categories to customize the Record Settings.

**Screen** – Customize capturing area on your desktop (full screen, target window or a specific region), set the preferred frame rate (up to 120 FPS) for your video. Or select, "Game" if you wish to record gameplay.

#### Step 5 – Edit Video, Add Effects and Export
