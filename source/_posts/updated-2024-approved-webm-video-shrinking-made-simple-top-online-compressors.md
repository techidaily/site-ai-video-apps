**Price:** Free

![Compress WebM with Compressify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compressify-compress-webm-video.jpg)

Reducing a video’s size with Compressify requires a minimum amount of effort because you just have to upload a WebM video and the platform will do the rest for you.

Compressify reduces the size of your video files by 60% while maintaining excellent image quality. Even though the size of WebM videos you upload to this platform cannot exceed 8MB, the file compression process is incredibly slow.

ClipChamp lets you choose the resolution, file format and quality of the output video file before starting the compression process. How much time ClipChamp is going to need to resize your WebM video depends on the video’s duration and its size.

### 7\. [Online Converter](https://www.onlineconverter.com/compress-video)

**Price:** Free

![Compress WebM with onlineconverter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/onlineconverter-compress-video.jpg)

A new page will load after the WebM video is compressed and you should click on the Download Now option to save the resized file to your computer.

**Conclusion**

Resizing a WebM or any other type of video file is a simple task that doesn’t require you to have advanced video editing skills. In fact, most online WebM compressors enable you to shrink videos in just a few easy steps. Even so, some online video compressors limit the size of WebM videos you can upload to them, which can prevent you from using them to reduce the size of your videos.
