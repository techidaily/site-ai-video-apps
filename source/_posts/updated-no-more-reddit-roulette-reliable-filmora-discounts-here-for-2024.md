Macgo Windows Blu-ray should also be equipped with a range of subtitle options that allow you to customize the color, size or the font of a video’s subtitles.

**Pros**

* Supports nearly all Blu-ray and video file formats
* Powerful audio playback features
* Displays image files
* Offers online video playback options

**Cons**

* This Blu-ray and DVD player is still in Beta stage

**Conclusion**

Even though Windows 10 doesn’t have a native DVD or Blu-ray players, finding a media player that enables you to watch video and audio content from Blu-ray or DVD discs shouldn’t be too difficult. Media players like Pot Player or VLC are powerful enough to provide smooth playback of all audio and video files for free, while DVD players like PowerDVD or KMPlayer are a better option if you are looking for a true home theater experience. Which DVD player for Windows 10 are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.
