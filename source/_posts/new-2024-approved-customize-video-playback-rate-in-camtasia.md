![changing frame rate on stop motion studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/changing-frame-rate-on-stop-motion-studio.jpg)

Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame.

Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.

Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screenâ€”select animated GIF from the pulldown menu.

Videos are the most popular types of content. They instantly convey the message and engage the consumers. However, the quality of your video is crucial from your business perspective. Video stabilizing software provides stability to videos and makes them look professional and smooth.

Even if you donâ€™t use video stabilizers for stabilizing videos for your business purposes, they can still come in handy while stabilizing your private videos.
