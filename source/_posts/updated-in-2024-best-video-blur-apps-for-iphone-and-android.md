**Step 2: Flipping the whole video:**

When you double-click on the video, the editing panel appears on the screen, and you go to the Video tab to use the **transform** options. There are different options in the transform menu, including flip, rotate position and scale.

* _Flipping only a single part of the video:_

Wondershare Filmora also allows you to flip a few parts of the video instead of whole. Just move the play head towards the position where you want the split. Click on the icon of **Scissors** in the menu.
