For an in-depth guide on how to use the software, we recommend watching the videos.

If you open AVS Video Editor for the first time, you'll notice that it shares many features with other editing software. Files can be dragged and dropped directly into the program or imported from other sources, such as your desktop or cloud storage.

The timeline displays several buttons for different functions once the media is loaded. A clip can be trimmed, enhanced with a filter, and text or music can be added.

## Conclusion

KineMaster for Mac is a renowned video editing software that offers some pro-level features for both novice and expert. But still, it lacks some exciting features. Be that as it may, we recommend you to get Filmora for your video editing task. It is easy to use and you can edit like a pro quickly.
