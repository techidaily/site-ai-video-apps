### 2\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

Another best option in contrast to KineMaster is iMovie. This video editor for Mac permits users to conduct basic video editing quickly. You can also add build-in video effects, transitions to polish your video. iMovie is one cool video editor that can replace KineMaster whenever. This editor device accompanies an exceptionally easy-to-use interface that is friendly for beginners.

Main Features:

* Very simple interface
* Color matching for consistent movie looks
* Classy themes
* Great chroma-keying tool
* Lots of audio tools

## Conclusion

KineMaster for Mac is a renowned video editing software that offers some pro-level features for both novice and expert. But still, it lacks some exciting features. Be that as it may, we recommend you to get Filmora for your video editing task. It is easy to use and you can edit like a pro quickly.
