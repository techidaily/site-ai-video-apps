Besides the free video watermarking software, here I highly recommend paid video editing software- [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It's definitely a better option since it's more convenient to use because of its user-friendly interface. Even if you're not a pro in video editing, you can watermark and edit your videos with ease. You just have to drag-n-drop the images or logos from your computer or other external devices for watermarking. Here is a detailed guide about how to add logo/watermark to video in Filmora.

Why you should use Filmora to add Logo/watermark? As you may see from the video above, in Filmora:

* you can add text as a watermark, an image and even a video as watermark;
* adjust the watermark position to anywhere in the video;
* apply various built-in text and titles effects to the logo and watermark file
