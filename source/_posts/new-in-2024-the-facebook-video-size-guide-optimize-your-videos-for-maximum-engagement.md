The app uses menus and can be dragged and dropped, so a single objective can be accomplished in different ways. You can control all functions from within the application frame, or dockable panels can be used to get a closer look at what needs to be done. A permanent reorganization of the workspace would be appreciated.

### **Videopad Video Editing Features**

VideoPad is the perfect balance between too much and not enough. Although there are not many options, it offers a reasonable selection of transitions for moving between clips and images, as well as a selection of filters to give them a unique look.

# Best Online Video Editors for Chromebook

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The increase in popularity of Chromebooks, over the past several years is more than justified because these devices have proven that they are much more than just a web-browsing tool. Using a Chromebook for educational purposes or to widen your network of business associates is becoming more common, while new upgrades of the OS bring improvements at an astounding rate.

However, editing visual content isn't that easy for Chromebook users, because Windows or Mac applications can't be used that easily on these devices. That is the reason why online video editors play a large role for all Chromebook owners who want to create videos that meet at least some of the professional standards. Luckily, currently, there is a large number of online video editors available that can offer a solid video editing experience to users who would like to piece their video clips together into visually attractive content.

Although the answer to this question will depend on the user's need and the reasons why they want to create a video, it is safe to say that the online video editors listed in this article are among the best that are currently available on the Internet. Let's have a look at some of the best online video editors that will help you create visually engaging videos.

#### 2.[Magisto](https://www.magisto.com/)

Depending on the price package users can have access to 20 or 30-minute timelines, which limits the possibilities of users who would like to produce longer videos.

PowToon web-based video editor is designed to enable non-professionals to create engaging and visually stunning animations. This animation software is available in Free, Pro, Business and Team pricing options, although the Free version of the software can offer only a small portion of the software's true potential. The price for Pro, Team and Business options ranges from $19 per month for a Pro version of the software to $59 per month for the Business option.

PowToon is a perfect tool for creation of business presentations and storyboards that tell your stories in an effective way. Users can have access to unlimited amounts of royalty free music, create animated charts and graphs or use a large number of visual effects. The software allows you to export 60 minutes of HD or 8 minutes of Full HD content per month, while you can download files in MP4, PDF or PPT file formats. Despite many advantages PowToon offers, it still may be considered expensive by some users.
