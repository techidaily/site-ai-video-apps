Stop motion animation is becoming more and more popular by the year, and it’s not surprising. This style of making animated films is done by taking objects, either dolls with joints or soft clay items, and manipulating them. The physical manipulations and changes are then photographed. Each photograph acts as a frame, and when you play the frames together quickly, it looks like the objects have been animated.

If you want to make this type of animation, then you want to find the best **stop motion animation software** that you can find. Some options out there are even free! In this article, we’re going to share the 8 best options for stop motion animation software, separating them by whether they are for Mac or PC.

Stop motion animation is becoming more and more popular by the year, and it’s not surprising. This style of making animated films is done by taking objects, either dolls with joints or soft clay items, and manipulating them. The physical manipulations and changes are then photographed. Each photograph acts as a frame, and when you play the frames together quickly, it looks like the objects have been animated.

If you want to make this type of animation, then you want to find the best **stop motion animation software** that you can find. Some options out there are even free! In this article, we’re going to share the 8 best options for stop motion animation software, separating them by whether they are for Mac or PC.

The size of the videos you capture with your Smartphone or digital camera can sometimes be just too large for online use. Videos recorded in Full HD or **4K resolutions** can take hours to upload to any of the video file hosting services and they often exceed the **video** **size limitations on social media networks.**

PC owners who often upload video content to their social media accounts or run a YouTube channel can **easily compress their footage on Windows 10**. There are a number of options that enable you to reduce the size of a video on the latest version of the Windows OS, but which one you are going to choose depends on a number of factors that range from your preferred method of reducing a video file’s size to how fast the compression process is.

In this article, we are going to take you through **nine best free video compressors for Windows 10** and help you discover the one you feel comfortable using.

* [Part 1: 9 Best Free Video Compressors for Windows 10](#part1)
* [Part 2: How Does Video Compression Work?](#part2)
* [Part 3: Commonly used Video Compression Methods](#part3)

## The 9 Best Free Video Compressors for Windows 10

You don’t need any [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) experience to compress videos with each of the free video compressors for Windows 10 we featured in this article. Before you opt for one free video compressor or the other you must first make sure that its **file compression capabilities** meet your demands. So, let’s take a look at the 9 best free video compressors for Windows 10.

### 1.[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \- \[Free trial and Paid subscription\]

If you want to reduce video file size without losing video quality, Filmora can help you reduce video size when you are exporting video. You can choose the different video bitrate, format and quality to reduce video file size. Key features of Wondershare Filmora are listed below.

* Cut off your unwanted segments of a video file.
* Enables you to change video resolution, bit rate and frame rate.

### 2.[Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

The Windows 10’s native Photos App offers a broad spectrum of photo and video editing tools that can be used even by novice photo and video editors. Besides the **standard photo editing features** that enable you to enhance your photos in just a few clicks, the [Photos App also lets you **trim**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, merge or add text overlays and filters to your videos.**

In order to compress a video file with the Photos App, you need to create a new project by clicking on the **New Video** drop-down menu and selecting the **New Video Project** option. You can then import the video clips you want to compress to the project you created and perform all other video editing tasks you want.

![Windows 10 Save

video in small size ](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows10-photos-app-compress-video-size.jpg>)

When done, you should click on the **Finish** **video** **button** and choose from **Small, Medium or Large** output video size before you start the video exporting. The only downside is that you **cannot choose the file format of the video you’re exporting from the Photos App.** Even so, you can compress MP4 videos to a smaller size with the Photos App for free, which makes it useful if you want to quickly compress a video before sharing it on social media.

### 3.[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

This is probably one of the **[best open-source media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**ever created because it supports all video file formats. Besides video playback capabilities, VLC also offers a number of video editing features that can help you remove unwanted parts of video clips or apply filters and effects. There are three different ways to compress a video in VLC.

You can either convert a file **by changing its output file format, adjusting the bitrate and the frame rate** or by cropping and recording segments of the video clip you want to compress.
