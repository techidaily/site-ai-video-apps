## The Ultimate AVS Video Editor Review : Pros, Cons, and Verdict

The AVS Video Editor edits videos and can make edits like cutting, trimming, splitting, and merging them. Both novices and professional filmmakers can use it because of its basic and advanced editing features. This recorder is compatible with DV/HDV, webcams, and VHS cameras. In addition, it allows you to capture the screen of your PC, take screenshots, and highlight mouse and keyboard movements with drawing tools.

The first time you boot up your computer after installing the software, you will see a popup for quick start instructions. It would be a great place to start someday, even if you skip it for now. For an in-depth guide on how to use the software, we recommend watching the videos.

If you open AVS Video Editor for the first time, you'll notice that it shares many features with other editing software. Files can be dragged and dropped directly into the program or imported from other sources, such as your desktop or cloud storage.

The timeline displays several buttons for different functions once the media is loaded. A clip can be trimmed, enhanced with a filter, and text or music can be added.

### How To Use AVS Video Editor?

As soon as you have downloaded and installed the software, follow the instructions. The first time you boot up your computer after installing the software, you will see a popup for quick start instructions. It would be a great place to start someday, even if you skip it for now. For an in-depth guide on how to use the software, we recommend watching the videos.

If you open AVS Video Editor for the first time, you'll notice that it shares many features with other editing software. Files can be dragged and dropped directly into the program or imported from other sources, such as your desktop or cloud storage. The camera can also capture media directly from the clipboard and even the desktop screen can be captured.

The timeline displays several buttons for different functions once the media is loaded. A clip can be trimmed, enhanced with a filter, and text or music can be added.

You can add a variety of effects to your videos using AVS Video Editor, which makes it stand out from other video editing software. There are thousands of preset transitions and visual filters available for use within the program once you've opened a clip. Audio and brightness adjustments can also be made.

Other video editing software does not offer the same features as this one. AVS Video Editor, for example, allows you to add watermarks and overlays to videos without any lag time or loss in quality, which would be impossible with other programs.

The animated logos and text in the video are another great feature. Adding an intro or outro to the end of your video will give it that professional touch before you publish it on YouTube.

It's free to download now.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

####

#### 1. Cut MP4 Video

To cut your MP4 video into certain parts, drag and drop the video on the Timeline and highlight it. Then place the red Time Indicator to where you want to cut the video, and click the Scissor button above the timeline.

After that, move the red marker to the end of the scene, and repeat this again to cut the video into several fragments. If you want to cut off the unwanted parts, right click the video and choose "Delete".

![export edited MP4 by cutting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cut-a-section.gif)

####

#### 2. Join MP4 Video

To join several MP4 video files into one, you just need to place all the video files on the timeline, adjust the order and hit "Create" to export it.

If you want to make the joined videos look like a really intact movie, just add transitions between clips for smooth change from one to next. To do this, click "Transition" tab on the main screen. Then drag the effect you like to the timeline to apply.

If you don't want to choose the transition one by one, let the software choose the transition randomly by right clicking and selecting "Random to All" option.

#### 3. Edit the audio of MP4 Video

Sometimes you may need to adjust the settings of audio. To do it, double click the video on the Timeline. Then a editing panel will pop up. Switch to the Audio column and you can easily change the Speed, Volume, Pitch of the audio file or add the Fade in/out effect to it.

Want to change the original audio track of your MP4 video?

No problem.

Just highlight your MP4 video, right click and choose "Audio Detach". The audio file of your video will immediately be separated and appear on the music timeline. Since it is separated from the video, you can easily delete the audio track or replace it with your own music.

If you want to make the joined videos look like a really intact movie, just add transitions between clips for smooth change from one to next. To do this, click "Transition" tab on the main screen. Then drag the effect you like to the timeline to apply.

If you don't want to choose the transition one by one, let the software choose the transition randomly by right clicking and selecting "Random to All" option.

#### 3. Edit the audio of MP4 Video

Sometimes you may need to adjust the settings of audio. To do it, double click the video on the Timeline. Then a editing panel will pop up. Switch to the Audio column and you can easily change the Speed, Volume, Pitch of the audio file or add the Fade in/out effect to it.

Want to change the original audio track of your MP4 video?

No problem.

Just highlight your MP4 video, right click and choose "Audio Detach". The audio file of your video will immediately be separated and appear on the music timeline. Since it is separated from the video, you can easily delete the audio track or replace it with your own music.

MP4 is a very common media format that can keep the high image and sound quality. Many downloaded movies, streaming music videos, or recorded video clips are with .MP4 file extension. Confused about different kinds of formats? Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY1IQUuQBME)to learn what video format is and the differences between video formats.

If you have many such files, chances are that you need to edit MP4 videos.

Although various MP4 editors are available on the market, they are a little space-consuming in order to ensure good performance. Here I'd like to share a powerful and efficient MP4 editor that designed for beginners and hobbyists.

## How to Easily Edit MP4 Video?

Before we proceed to illustrate every detail on how to edit the MP4 video, you can download the MP4 editor first so you can follow the below steps one by one.

It's free to download now.

####

#### 1. Cut MP4 Video

To cut your MP4 video into certain parts, drag and drop the video on the Timeline and highlight it. Then place the red Time Indicator to where you want to cut the video, and click the Scissor button above the timeline.

After that, move the red marker to the end of the scene, and repeat this again to cut the video into several fragments. If you want to cut off the unwanted parts, right click the video and choose "Delete".

####

#### 2. Join MP4 Video

To join several MP4 video files into one, you just need to place all the video files on the timeline, adjust the order and hit "Create" to export it.

If you want to make the joined videos look like a really intact movie, just add transitions between clips for smooth change from one to next. To do this, click "Transition" tab on the main screen. Then drag the effect you like to the timeline to apply.
