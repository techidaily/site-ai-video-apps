## Basic Video Editing Terms You Should Know

Below are some of the important yet basic terms that you should know related to videography in general and video editing in specific as well, whether you are a beginner or professional.

**Aspect ratio:**

The aspect ratio is the ratio of width and height of a video. Examples of the most used aspect ratios are: 4:3, 16:9, 1.85:1.

Refer to the image given below for a better understanding.

![aspec ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/aspec-ratio.jpg)

**B-roll:**

B-roll facilities one with the flexibility, when editing, to the video editing rules as it is an add-on picture that makes a previously incoherent scene seamless.

As shown in the image below, B-roll is used to insert which can make the transition easy to look on the eyes.

**Bit rate:**

Bit rate, also known as data rate, refers to the amount of data used for every second within the video. It is most commonly expressed in kilobits per second (kbps).

**Close up:**

Close-up refers to the shots that frame to subject tightly.

For instance, if it is a person, then the close-up covers solely his face.

**Color temperature:**

Color temperature refers to the light visibility in a shot. Color temperature is expressed in Kelvin. The scale of color temperature ranges from cool to warm.

![color temperature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/color-temperature.jpg)

**Composition:**

Composition entails the process of combining multiple footages using video editing software.

**Compression:**

Compression is the process of minimizing the quantity of data utilized in a video file. It helps make in the process of uploading and downloading quite faster. This also leaves you with ample space for more of your publications.

**Crop factor:**

Crop factor refers to a number that expresses the ratio of the imaging area of a sensor to a full-frame sensor. It typically ranges from 1.3 to 2.0.

**Cut-in**

Cut-in refers to showing a specific part of a subject in order to emphasize a certain aspect or emotion. For instance, hand gestures may show nervousness, enthusiasm, agitation, etc.

**Foley:**

Often times the original sound of the scene captured in the video is not captured as naturally as they were supposed to sound like in reality. Hence, Foley is when you reproduce those sounds for that video.

**Frame rate:**

Frame rate refers to the video capturing by a shutter in a second or shutter cycling rate through opening and closing. Some of the common frame rates are 24, 25, 29.97, 30, etc. The frame rate is expressed in frames per second (fps).

**High definition media interface:**

HDMI is the connectors that digitally transfer audio and HD video to a television. This is helpful if you intend to work on a bigger screen or wish to share some of your productions.

**Resolution:**

Resolution refers to the horizontal and vertical pixels of your video. For instance 640×480 for SD and 1280×720 for HD. Sometimes resolution refers only to the number of pixels that paper vertically. For example 480p, 720p, and 1080p respectively.

![resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resolution.jpg)

**J-Cut:**

J-cut refers to the editing technique in which the audio from a next scene is overlapped with the image from the previous scene, such that the audio segment of the next scene begins playing prior to its picture.

**Jumpcut:**

Jumpcut editing techniques refer to an abrupt transition between the two consecutive frames. The entity in the video containing jump cuts appears to jump along with the scene from one place to another. This looks disruptive to the audience.

**L-Cut:**

L-cut is exactly opposite to J-cut where the audio from the next scene overlays the image from the next scene to play the audio after an image has been displayed in the video.

**Lower third:**

As the name suggests, the lower third is derived from the rule of third which refers to the type of title, mostly used by vloggers, broadcasters, interviewers, and you tubers.

**Memory bank**:

You can understand the term by thinking of a memory box where we keep certain things as a memory of the events in someone’s life. Memory bank serves the same purpose through the use of video. It often uses natural sounds, document travel or merely store moments in routine life.

**Press kit:**

Press kit is used to provide information regarding your productions to the press for promotional purposes. Such information is often background including synopsis, crew, cast’s bios Q&A with the director, production stills and its reviews.

**Shot list:**

The shot list refers to the checklist related to the shots that a videographer plans to include in his/her content. This may help you save time and gear with efficient planning and handling. This gives a sense of direction to your production.

**Storyboard:**

A storyboard is a drawing to illustrate the scenes in the video. This gives a direct and organized way to visualize the needs for the shots or animation.

![storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/storyboard.jpg)

**Sync:**

Synchronization, aka sync, refers to the alignment of audio with video imaging.

**Rule of thirds:**

The rule of third is a grid that helps you to compose interesting and balanced shots to make your productions aesthetically pleasing. The grid is similar to a tic-tac-toe board since it segregates the picture into 9 segments. It helps bring points of interest to be aligned with the lines or intersection given in the grid.

![rule of thirds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/rule-of-thirds.jpg)

**Three-point lighting:**

This helps one to diminish the shadows for image balancing and provides an appealing contrast. These three lights are commonly known as fill, key, and backlight.

![three point lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/three-point-lighting.jpg)

**Tilts:**

Tilts refer to the vertical transitions that your camera. This is the opposite of pans.

![tilts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/tilts.jpg)

**Pans:**

Pans refer to the horizontal movements of your camera. This is exactly contrary to tilts.

**White balance:**

White balance refers to the process where the unrealistic color casts are removed in order to render a white object to be actually white in your photo, and not have other tints.

![white balance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/white-balance.jpg)

**Wide-angle:**

A wide-angel lens refers to a short focal length of a lens. This brings more of a subject rather than a subject being captured by a normal lens at equal distances.

![wide angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/wide-angle.jpg)

**Non-linear editing:**

NLEs is a non-destructive editing technique that allows one to access any frame in a video clip regardless of the sequence in the clip. It gives you the freedom to easily include effects, transitions, fades, etc. which cannot be achieved with linear editing

**Pixel aspect ratio:**

Pixels are several tiny squares that build up an image in a video. Whereas, aspect ratio refers to the ratio of width to height of a video. Hence, the pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the ratio of width to height of the pixels.

Be it Instagram stories, YouTube product testimonials, or Facebook ads, using these easy-to-use video editing software will elevate your content into a professional and slick look.

So, I hope you are now ready to get started.

We have eight recommendations for you below that will allow you to pretty much do whatever you want (i.e., **convert FLAC to MP3**, convert **FLAC to ALAC**, **convert WAV to FLAC**, MP4 to FLAC, FLAC to MP4, M4A to FLAC, WAV to FLAC, and so much more.)

We've even included a handy general tutorial just after this to make sure that you're able to easily make use of your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)](#Part 1)

02 [8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)**

As promised, we'll be starting this off with a general tutorial that you can refer to when using the converters that we've listed below! The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

Here's a link to FreeConvert in case you wanted to try it out for yourself:

### 02**Step 2: Confirm Output Format!**

For our example, we'll be converting from **FLAC to MP3**. And so, when prompted to choose the desired output format, we choose "MP3"!

(Most converters will have multiple audio file formats and video file formats that you can convert to if you want to do something completely different — as is shown below):

![Confirm MP3 as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%202.png)

### 03**Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Settings**

Before finishing up, you might want to explore the extra advanced settings offered by your chosen **FLAC Converter**! Each one will have different features.

FreeConvert, as an example, will allow you to adjust volume, add fade-in, add fade-out, reverse audio, and, even, trim audio before conversion! All you have to do to access these functions is to click the "SETTINGS" icon (pointed out in the image).

### 04**Step 4: Convert FLAC to MP3**

To initiate the actual conversion with FreeConvert, all you really need to do is click the 'Convert to MP3' button. Other **FLAC converter**s, while not the same, should be similar.

![Select Convert to MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%204.png)

02 [8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)**

As promised, we'll be starting this off with a general tutorial that you can refer to when using the converters that we've listed below! The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

We have eight recommendations for you below that will allow you to pretty much do whatever you want (i.e., **convert FLAC to MP3**, convert **FLAC to ALAC**, **convert WAV to FLAC**, MP4 to FLAC, FLAC to MP4, M4A to FLAC, WAV to FLAC, and so much more.)

We've even included a handy general tutorial just after this to make sure that you're able to easily make use of your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)](#Part 1)

02 [8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)**

As promised, we'll be starting this off with a general tutorial that you can refer to when using the converters that we've listed below! The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

Here's a link to FreeConvert in case you wanted to try it out for yourself:

![Upload FLAC Audio File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%201.png)

### 02**Step 2: Confirm Output Format!**

For our example, we'll be converting from **FLAC to MP3**. And so, when prompted to choose the desired output format, we choose "MP3"!

(Most converters will have multiple audio file formats and video file formats that you can convert to if you want to do something completely different — as is shown below):

![Confirm MP3 as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%202.png)

### 03**Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Settings**

Before finishing up, you might want to explore the extra advanced settings offered by your chosen **FLAC Converter**! Each one will have different features.

FreeConvert, as an example, will allow you to adjust volume, add fade-in, add fade-out, reverse audio, and, even, trim audio before conversion! All you have to do to access these functions is to click the "SETTINGS" icon (pointed out in the image).

![Advance Settings Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%203.png)

### 04**Step 4: Convert FLAC to MP3**

To initiate the actual conversion with FreeConvert, all you really need to do is click the 'Convert to MP3' button. Other **FLAC converter**s, while not the same, should be similar.

![Select Convert to MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%204.png)

### 05**Step 5: Download Converted FLAC Audio!**

Finally, when the conversion has been completed, select the 'Download MP3' button to save your converted audio to your PC! That's it, you're done!

If you would like to gain access to premium features such as adding a logo or choosing the font of the text you would like to use in your slideshows, you will either have to purchase Adobe Spark as a stand-alone app or as a part of the Adobe’s Creative Cloud Plan. Creating a slideshow with Adobe Spark is remarkably easy since you just have to insert the text, pick a template and upload the photos you would like to add to the slideshow.

## 10+ Best Free and Paid Online Image to Video Makers

Despite the fact that online images to video makers aren’t as powerful as photo and video editing software products such as Filmora, you can still use this online image-to-video maker to create videos effortlessly. However, in order to save time you should prepare all the material you want to use in your video in advance so that you can just upload it to the platform of your choosing and have the video ready in a couple of minutes. Let’s have a look at the image to video makers you can use to create captivating social media videos.

#### 2. [Image to Video](https://imagetovideo.com/)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/image-to-video-online.jpg)

This website offers a bunch of different tools you can utilize to produce videos from your photos, trim videos or add 3D transitions between shots. Keep in mind that the maximum number of photos you can use in a single video is limited to thirty. Once you arrive on the home page of this platform you just have to upload the photos and rearrange them in any way you want.

You can also add, text, music, or your company’s logo to the video and then just follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. You can preview the video after the platform generates it, and decide whether you want to download it or start from the beginning in case you didn’t like the result.

#### 3. [Kapwing: Image to Video Tool](https://www.kapwing.com/image-to-video)

**Price:** Free, Paid to Remove watermark

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-image-to-video-online.jpg)

This [online video editing platform](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) enables its users to perform a number of basic video editing actions like trimming videos, adding text to them or resizing them. The Image to Video tool can be quite useful if you are looking for a quick way to convert an image to a video and then select an [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that fits the requirements of the social network to which you would like to upload that video.

#### 4. [Picovico: Instant Photo to Birthday Video Maker Online](https://picovico.com/)

**Price:** $9.99, Free version available

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picovico-image-to-video-online.jpg)

Turning your or your children’s birthday photos into charming videos you can share on social media is easy with Picovico. However, in order to start using the free or paid version of this image to video maker, you first have to create an account and make sure that you are signed in. In addition, if you opt for the free version of Picovico, all videos you create are going to be watermarked, and their quality and duration are going to be limited. So, in order to produce full HD videos that can contain several songs, you **must purchase the Birthday Bash subscription plan**.

#### 5. [Pholody](https://www.pholody.com/editor)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pholody-image-to-video-online.jpg)

Besides creating videos from your photos, Pholody also lets you use the Happy Birthday, Merry Christmas or Around the World templates. If you choose to create videos from your own photos, you can save the project you’re working on, and then load it whenever you want to continue working on it. You can import the sound or music files from a hard drive on your computer or you can use the YouTube link to import any audio file you want into your project. Publishing your videos to social media networks requires you to be signed in to your account on Pholody.

#### 6. [Mp3Care Photo to Video](https://www.mp3care.com/)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MP3Care-image-to-video-online.jpg)

This web-based app makes converting JPEG files into MP4 video files a simple two-step process, that just requires you to upload photos and then choose the amount time between two images. The maximum number of photos you can use in a video is limited to just **twenty**, while the maximum duration of each image in the video can’t exceed the **20-second** mark. Adding transitions between pictures is also on the list of options this platform provides, but Mp3 Care Photo to Video lacks any other video editing features. Despite some obvious downsides, this online photo to video maker is still a great option if you want to convert your photos into videos quickly and free of charge.

#### 7. [Kizoa](https://www.kizoa.com/home)

**Price:** Free, Subscription plans start at $29.99

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kizoa-image-to-video-online.jpg)

Kizoa is an online video editor that lets you turn your photos in your videos, so you just have to choose the images you want to use in your project and upload them to the platform. Furthermore, even the free version of the app lets you store up to **1GB** of photos and videos, which makes accessing your footage even easier. Nonetheless, the free version of Kizoa only allows you to export videos **shorter than two minutes** and you **must** **purchase** one of the available subscription plans **in order to be able to export** videos that last more than **ten minutes** or to create 4K videos.

#### 8. [Movie Maker Online](https://moviemakeronline.com/)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/image-to-video-online-movie-maker-online.jpg)

If you don’t already have the photos you want to use in your video, the Movie Maker Online is an excellent choice for you, because the platform offers a rich selection of royalty free images. Additionally, you also use Movie Maker Online to search for free music you can use in your videos without having to worry about the copyrights. The platform’s interface, however, is far from perfect and it may take you some time to get used to it and figure out how to add text to the photos you’re using in your video or how to choose for how long a photo is going to be displayed on the screen.

#### 9. [Slideshow Photos](https://slideshow.photos/)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slide-show-online-image-to-video-online.jpg)

You can create professional slideshows with this web-based app in a few easy steps, as you just have to select one out of four available templates and then upload at least 27 photos. Once you finish uploading the images, you can proceed to add text to your slideshow and then click on the Create a Slideshow button. The platform will then ask for your email address and it will send you an email that informs you that your video is going to be ready **in 11 hours unless you want to pay $4 to speed up the delivery time**.

#### 10. [PhotoShow](http://www.photoshow.com/home/start)

**Price:** Free version available, subscription plans start at $2.49 per month

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/image-to-video-online.jpg)

 PhotoShow lets you create slideshows in three easy steps. After you upload the photos you want to use in a slideshow, you can preview the results and customize them in accordance with your demands and then you can share the slideshow. However, you will have to install the latest version of Adobe’s Flash Player in order to use this platform, so make sure that this software is updated before you start creating a new slideshow with it. If you choose one of the subscription plans, you will be able to enhance each photo you include in your slideshow, before you export it to social media.

#### 11. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/slideshow-maker/)

**Price:** Free, Available through Adobe Creative Cloud Plan for $52.99 per month or as a stand-alone app for $9.99 per month

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/image-to-video-online-adobe-spark.jpg)

In order to start using Adobe Spark, you will first have to use your Google or Facebook account to sign in to your Adobe account.

If you would like to gain access to premium features such as adding a logo or choosing the font of the text you would like to use in your slideshows, you will either have to purchase Adobe Spark as a stand-alone app or as a part of the Adobe’s Creative Cloud Plan. Creating a slideshow with Adobe Spark is remarkably easy since you just have to insert the text, pick a template and upload the photos you would like to add to the slideshow.
