There are two broad categories of effects in Final Cut Pro X: Inspector effects and Effects Browser effects.

I've written previously about how to use Inspector effects to create a [picture-in-picture](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) effect, among many other effects available to us in Final Cut Pro. In this article, I want to show you how to apply an effect to a clip, modify that effect, temporarily turn that effect on or off, or delete it entirely.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## How to Apply Effects to Video in Final Cut Pro X

* [Find and apply an effect](#part1)
* [Modify an effect](#part2)
* [Disable and delete an effect](#part3)
* [Extra credit](#part4)

#### Find and apply an effect

Here is our clip - a fearsome polar bear.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx001.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To apply an effect, first select the clip in the Timeline.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx002.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Then, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Effects Browser (or type Cmd + 5).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx003.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The Browser, like all the effects browsers, lists categories of effects on the left, a search box at the bottom to use for searching for the names of effects, and effects for each category on the right.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx004.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Here, for example, I've selected the Blur category, with my cursor near the Gaussian blur effect. (Gaussian blur is the best effect to use when you want a clip to look blurry.)

To apply an effect, do one of two things:

* Drag the effect from the Browser onto the clip you want to change.
* If the clip, or clips, are selected, double-click the effect in the Browser to apply it.

#### Modify an effect

To modify an effect, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Inspector (or type Cmd + 4).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx005.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Click the Video tab in the Inspector. Effects from the Effects Browser are always listed at the top of the Inspector.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx006.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Grab a slider and drag it to see what happens. For example, to make an image blurrier, drag the Amount slider to the right. To lessen the effect, drag it to the left.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx007.jpg "add effects in fcp")

#### Disable and delete an effect

To temporarily disable an effect, without deleting it, click the blue box so that it turns gray.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx008.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To enable an effect, click the gray box so it turns blue again.

To delete an effect, click the name of the effect - in this example: Gaussian - and press the big Delete key.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx009.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The effect will be deleted from the selected clip.

#### Extra credit

You can apply, modify, even delete the same effect to multiple clips by first selecting all the clips you want to change in the Timeline then adding, changing the settings, or deleting an effect in the Inspector.

#### Summary

The process of applying effects is the same for all effects you apply from the Effects Browser. In future articles I'll show you how to use this technique to create a wide variety of different effects in Final Cut Pro X.

### 1\. Adobe Premiere Pro CC \[Desktop\]

Reckoned as one of the best in the editing space, Adobe Premiere Pro CC is a fantastic choice for video trimming both for windows and iOS; hence its place is the first. You can complete your editing project in a few minutes, thanks to exceptional features like curve modifications and automatic reformatting, making it very easy to change the video’s mid/ black and white level. With total ease, you can export to your PC, and the rendering process is relatively fast.

![video trimmer for pc- adoble premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/video-trimmer-for-pc-1.jpg)

### 2\. Wondershare Filmora \[Desktop\]

Ever thought of having an all-in-one Video trimmer for your PC? Then Wondershare Filmora is just the best choice. This means that you wouldn’t have to use other software or merge with other apps to complete your editing, as it works well both for corporate and personal purposes. The software offers amazing options like rotation, trimming, jump cut, and even special effects if you need special effects. With a slick and relatively easy-to-navigate user interface, Filmora gives you an option to merge to videos within seconds.

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The user interface is slick and simple.

User tutorial for easy navigation.

##### Cons

Premium members alone have access to updates.

Watermark on videos for free users.

Low operations speed while working on multiple projects.

### 3\. Flexclip \[Online\]

FlexClip makes online editing stress-free. Not just that it eliminates the hassle of PC installation, it gives more flexibility on video trimming than many other online solutions; hence the name FlexClip. It helps with sound extraction and video trims with a good interface that previews edits. FlexClip might be a nice option for you to create social media videos.

![video trimmer for pc- Flexclip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/video-trimmer-for-pc-2.jpg)

##### Pros

Can share on social media in a few clicks.

Color grids and voice recording are available.

Free templates to use.

##### Cons

Watermark on videos while on the free version

It has a limit of 1 minute and about 12 videos while on the free option.

### 4\. Movavi Video Editor

Are you looking for reliable video editing software? Then Movavi is one of the best options to try out. It might not be comfortable for beginners due to the price, but it best suits it. It allows for speedy trimming and conversion with a user-friendly interface. If you only have a minimum of 2GB RAM and 400 MB available space to install this software on iOS and Windows devices, this might be the best option.

Unlike some PC video trimmers, Movavi features a sophisticated tool that assists with audio extraction if you need to add additional sounds. Although it offers a free trial, the best features are only available when upgrading to the Premium or Premium Plus plan.

![video trimmer for pc- Movavi](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/video-trimmer-for-pc-3.jpg)

##### Pros

Fantastic sound and transition feature.

Slick movie-making tools.

Allows motion tracking.

##### Cons

No advanced features.

Slow rendering.

It does not work on M1 from Apple.

### 5\. Gihosoft Free Video Cutter

It seems Gihosoft programmers understand that all fingers are not equal, and sometimes we need editing help on a budget. Therefore, if you need to trim videos on your PC while on a budget and maintain the quality, you might give Gihosoft a trial. You can trim and edit videos of different formats in a few seconds. Import and export of files work fine, and it has an easy-to-use interface and supports frame-by-frame edits.

![video trimmer for pc- Gihosoft](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/video-trimmer-for-pc-4.jpg)

##### Pros

Free software with fast features.

High-quality results.

Fantastic for hand-drawn art styles.

##### Cons

Video saving is relatively slow.

Best for minor video editing, not for complex options.

Cannot add Watermarks or customized logo.

### 6\. DaVinci Resolve

DaVinci is an amazing tool for all-around editing, and not just for video trimming because it offers amazing editing options like audio enhancement, color correction, special effects, and animation, all for a one-time fee of $357.01\. It works perfectly fine on Linux, Windows, and iOS; though you might need to use it with other editing software, the available features are amazing for professional editing. Access to updated features is available to premium users alone, though there’s a free option.

![video trimmer for pc- davinci resolve](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/video-trimmer-for-pc-5.jpg)

##### Pros

The free option is great for personal videos.

Explicit tutorial videos.

Simple features.

##### Cons

It cannot sometimes export due to Fusion editing.

The interface is a bit hard to navigate.

### 7\. Cyberlink PowerDirector

Though desktop video trimmers are amazing, some options make it easy for editors to handle professional projects, and Cyberlink PowerDirector meets that list. Not just as a video trimmer but as a video editing software that supports a wide range of file formats, including MKV, , MP4, M2TS, and XAVC. You can resize for upload on stream sites like YouTube and Vimeo.

Want to try it out? There is an option for a 30-days free trial, with watermarks on edited videos, though. And you can’t save 4K videos too.

![video trimmer for pc-power director](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/video-trimmer-for-pc-6.jpg)

##### Pros

Relatively fast and easy to use for editing

Special features including effects and video splitting

##### Cons

Not enough features to animate texts.

No guide on how to use plugins.

Transitions are not much.

### 8\. Clideo

## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.
