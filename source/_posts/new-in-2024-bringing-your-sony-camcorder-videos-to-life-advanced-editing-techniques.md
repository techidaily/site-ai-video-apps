Making videos and shooting short films has been growing in popularity for several reasons, among them the proliferation of high-traffic sharing sites like YouTube, and the increased availability of professional quality camcorders and video devices. It's very easy today to become proficient enough to shoot high-quality videos for entertainment, for business and to assist with teaching. Sony is one of the brands that are popular with video makers, and in this tutorial we walk you through the steps on editing videos shot by Sony camcorder.

## How to Edit Videos Shot by Sony Digital Camcorder

### Video editing software for Sony camcorder

Video editing software is tiered by level, with options available for basic, mediate, and advanced programs. Here's a closer look at select software options:

* [Basic Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders](#part1)
* [Mediate Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders](#part2)
* [Advanced Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders](#part2)

### Basic Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders

#### 1\. Wondershare Filmora

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (Latest version X) is not only one of the most affordable video editing software options, it's also one of the most advanced. The interface is simple, but there are numerous advanced features available, including overlays, filters, audio editing features and more.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 2\.  Windows Movie Maker

It comes free with Windows, is designed with ease-of-use in mind and offers a surprisingly robust package of features. Convenience and simplicity make Windows Movie Maker the top free video editing software.

[See how to edit videos with Windows Movie Maker here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### Mediate Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders

#### 1\. Magix Movie Edit Pro

It excels in areas of advanced features, formats supported and attractive interface. However, it loses points for slow rendering performance and some complexity in the interface. The low price makes the exchange worth it for many users.

![video editor for sony camcorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-video-pro-interface.jpg)

#### 2\. Lightworks

It has an extensive list of features and capabilities that provide as near to professional performance as you can find in a free video editing program. The learning curve is a little steep, but if you're willing to invest the time then you have access to a powerful program.

![video editor for sony camcorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lightworks.jpg)

### Advanced Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders

#### 1\. Movie Studio 13 Suite

It is from Sony, so you can expect that it works well with Sony digital camcorders. The interface is more inviting than is usually the case with a product aimed at professionals and the roster of advanced features is top-notch. Other than the price, there are very few drawbacks to this product.

![video editor for sony camcorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movie-studio.jpg)

**Final tip**: Understand what you want and balance your needs against your budget and your interest in learning a new application, then you will be able to select the best software to edit videos shot on your Sony camcorder.

## How to edit videos shot by Sony camcorder

How easy is it to edit videos shot by Sony digital camcorder? This easy:

* **Step 1**: Shoot your video
* **Step 2**: Transfer the video from camcorder to computer (using either USB connection or using the SD card).
* **Step 3**: Use video editing software to edit your video on the computer.

Steps 1 and 2 are so easy they need no explanation. Step 3 is where you might need some help and some explanation of your options for editing videos shot by Sony digital camcorder is worthwhile.

To edit and enhance videos in Windows-based PC, Windows Movie Maker has always been touted as the default Microsoft Video Editor, although it has been discontinued by Microsoft on Janauary 10, 2017 and replaced by [Windows Story Remix (only for Windows 8/10)](https://www.howtogeek.com/355524/how-to-use-windows-10s-hidden-video-editor/), you can still download it on many platforms. However, you may often fail to import their video clips because it only supports WMV ASF, .MPG (MPEG-1), .AVI (DV-AVI), .WMA, .WAV, and .MP3\. Plus, the transitions and effects provided are quite limited, nothing fancy. If this is the case, you'll find a great microsoft video editing software here.

 Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.

## What Are Public Domain Images?

 By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:

* Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain
* A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect
* A photo was never the subject to copyright

 It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.

## How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?

 A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, you’ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.

## Best Websites for Downloading Public Domain Images

There are more than 49 million images, illustrations, vector graphics and videos available that can be downloaded for free. Some media files on Wikimedia Commons have certain restrictions, but these restrictions are mostly related to image citations, which means that you can use them only if you credit the author.

Alternatively, you can insert a keyword into a search bar and Unsplash will show you the results within seconds.

 Morguefile is a website that offers stock footage to its users, but some of the images can’t be downloaded for free. That’s why you must click on the Free Photos tab before you start searching for public domain images on this website. The website hosts nearly 400.000 photos, videos, and vector graphics, but you must make sure that a file you want to download is within the public domain before you download it. The only downside is that the images aren’t organized into categories which can make finding the images you’re searching for more difficult than it needs to be.

**Pros:**

* Creating an account on Morguefile is free
* All free photos can be used on commercial projects

**Cons:**

* Images can be organized better

However, the amount of public domain images this website offers is limited and if you want to download the images from the collections of works created by famous artists from the late 19th and early 20th centuries you must purchase the premium version of Viintage. The website lacks some basic search options as it only allows you to type in the search term into the search bar.

## How to Cite Public Domain Images Properly?

 If you’re planning on using a public domain image in a blog or on your website, you must cite the source from which you acquired a particular image. The image citations should include the following information:

* The title of the image
* Author’s name
* Information about the institution at which an image is kept
* The source from which you acquired an image

 In case you don’t have access to all of these information or if the information is simply not available you should include all details about a public domain image you have the access to.

 Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.

## What Are Public Domain Images?

 By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:

* Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain
* A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect
* A photo was never the subject to copyright

 It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.

## How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?

 A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, you’ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.

The images are not organized into categories which further complicates the process of finding a public domain image you’re looking for.

**Pros:**

* Offers a collection of rare vintage public domain images
* A great resource for graphic designers

**Cons:**

* Most images on Viintage can’t be downloaded for free
* Search tools are far from perfect

## How to Cite Public Domain Images Properly?

 If you’re planning on using a public domain image in a blog or on your website, you must cite the source from which you acquired a particular image. The image citations should include the following information:

* The title of the image
* Author’s name
* Information about the institution at which an image is kept
* The source from which you acquired an image

 In case you don’t have access to all of these information or if the information is simply not available you should include all details about a public domain image you have the access to. Furthermore, there are several styles of image citations that depend on the source from which an image was acquired.

**Conclusion**

 Spending large sums of money on images you can use in commercial or private projects is not always necessary. The public domain images are widely available and they can be used in a broad range of contexts. Which website that lets you download public domain images do you like to use the most? Leave a comment and share your opinions with us.
