Today we will take a look at the best motion tracking video editing apps for iOS & Android devices. We’ll also learn how to do motion tracking and add objects to the tracked path in each app.

Motion tracking is a technique that allows you to track moving objects in a video clip. You can blur faces/objects, add texts, clip arts, images, video clips to the tracked object. In the not so distant past, motion tracking was a processing-intensive feature that required a PC with a dedicated GPU, extra RAM & sophisticated editing software. But recent revolutions of mobile operating systems, hardware & apps have paved the way for motion tracking on mobile devices.

## Track Moving Objects and Follow Movement in Videos with Filmora

The newly added motion tracking feature in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allows you to track moving objects in a video clip easily, and then add clipart such as images, elements, texts and video clips to follow the movement automatically. Below is a video tutorial about how to use the motion tracking feature to pin text to video in Filmora. Download the free trial version below and inspire your creativity.

## Best Motion Tracking Apps for iOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android

So, what are the best motion tracking apps? What are their key features? And how can you do motion tracking on these apps? Below, we answer all these questions.

### 1\. LumaFusion

**Pricing:** $29.99

**Operating System:** iOS

LumaFusion is one of the most powerful video editors for iOS devices. It is a multi-track video editor with features similar to professional [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) like Adobe Premiere Pro. You can export your video to Final Cut Pro X (FCPXML) or archive it for editing later on another iOS device. Frame rates of up to 240fps are supported with forward & reverse Slow/Fast motion. Professional-grade color LUTs, layer effects, and audio editing are also available. There is a handy auto-ducking feature that ducks the background automatically during dialog. The interface is a bit daunting for novices. They compensate for that by providing free support & video tutorials for almost everything.

#### How to do Motion Tracking on LumaFusion?

LumaFusion is a professional-grade motion tracking app. Tracking doesn't necessarily take longer in LumaFusion than professional alternatives like Premiere Pro. Moreover, while many professional editing apps encounter lagging when you add too many keyframes and layers, that is typically not an issue in LumaFusion.

**You begin by importing your clip.** Next, add an object1 layer (text, video, clip-art, etc.) on top of your clip & adjust its start and endpoint. Edit the added object1 (graphics, position, etc.) if you want.

Then, add a suitable shape to your object1 layer. This shape will dictate the precise position of your tracking points. Now move the object + shape to the object2 you want to track. Remember the position of the shape with respect to the tracked object2. Add a keyframe, then move forward on the timeline.

Match the object1 \+ shape position with respect to your object2 similar to the previous one. Add another keyframe. Keep on repeating this process of following object2 with object1 \+ shape. Play through the timeline to check once you’re done. Don’t forget to delete the shape afterward because we don’t want that in our exported clip. That's it, we're done. A bit tedious but easy.

### 2\. KineMaster

**Pricing:** Free

**Operating System:** iOS & Android

KineMaster is another multi-track video editor. It has been one of the leaders in the mobile editing industry for several years.

The blending modes of KineMaster can be utilized to produce unique startling effects. The color adjustment tools have sufficient capability to meet all your correction and enhancing needs.

You can change your voice, add sound effects, and multiple layers of video, images, stickers, special effects, text & handwriting.

It also comes with slow-motion, ducking, volume envelope, color filters, and more. When you're done, you can export in 4K 2160p (30fps).

The free version gives you access to all the editing tools, but be aware of ads & watermarks. Buying the KineMaster premium will remove the watermarks and ads, unlock professional tool presets, and give you access to over a thousand premium assets.

#### How to do Motion Tracking on KineMaster?

Motion tracking in KineMaster is done using the animation tab. The overall interface is a lot simpler compared to LumaFusion. Simplicity, however, results in a lack of functionality. You can’t add a shape like the one we used in LumaFusion to make sure our added object1 always aligned perfectly with the object2 we were tracking.

The first step of motion tracking in KineMaster is importing your clip. Next, add an object1 layer (text, video, clip-art, etc). Adjust the duration & position of the object1 layer in the timeline according to the motion tracking duration & position for your clip.

Now launch the animation tab. Move the added object1 to the point of the object2 you want to track. You can zoom in using two fingers for accuracy. Once the object1 is in place, add a keyframe by tapping on the plus button.

Go forward to the next frame and add another keyframe after positioning. Keep on repeating this process of following object2 with object1. Play through the timeline once you’re done. If you made a mistake, use the minus button to remove a keyframe.

 **Conclusion**

After thoroughly examining the two motion tracking apps, we recommend LumaFusion for professionals who need precise control over motion tracking. Android users should not be disappointed, however, since the capability of KineMaster is not far behind.

KineMaster is the better option for amateurs due to its simpler UI. Whichever one you choose, you would be satisfied with the motion tracking functionality. We hope we have helped you choose the best motion tracking video editing app for your mobile device. Happy tracking!

There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.

The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a [90-day free trial of FCPX.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.

## **Part 1: What is in Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education?**

The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.

Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.

![pro-apps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/pro-apps.png)

 Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99\. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There's no time limit to ownership, and it doesn't ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.

Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you're thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99\. Motion and Compressor aren't sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.

**So, exactly how much are you saving here?**

If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you'll be saving $100\. You'll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you'll be saving **$330**—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don't anyone offers that kind of deal.

If you're a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that's your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.

For beginners who don't actually need those many apps can always go with a **cheaper yet maybe better editor, Filmora**. Click and have a try!

## **Part 1: What is in Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education?**

The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.

Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.

![pro-apps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/pro-apps.png)

 Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99\. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There's no time limit to ownership, and it doesn't ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.

Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you're thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99\. Motion and Compressor aren't sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.

**So, exactly how much are you saving here?**

If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you'll be saving $100\. You'll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you'll be saving **$330**—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don't anyone offers that kind of deal.

If you're a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that's your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.

## The Ultimate List of Free Commercial-Use Image Websites

Did you know that some of the world's most iconic advertisements use stock images for commercial use? For example, AlamapBBDO, a Brazilian ad agency, used stock photos from Getty Images to create their [Endless Possibilities campaign](https://thinkmarketingmagazine.com/getty-images-brilliant-campaign-re-create-4-famous-faces-out-of-random-stock-photos/) in 2016\. The advertising campaign combined photos of random people's faces to recreate portraits of famous people such as the Dalai Lama and Pope Francis.

![images for commercial use](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-1.jpg)

Most creative agencies prefer altering stock images in most of their work. This is because it allows them to create campaigns for different companies much faster at affordable costs. Keep reading to find out how to get free images for commercial use in your next project.

## Part 1: Download images in loyalty-free sites

Several sites offer free images for commercial use as part of their services. In addition, you do not need to register an account to download the images. The sites typically rely on user contributions and content teams to ensure their databases are fresh and maintain consistent quality. Furthermore, all creative assets they offer fall under the creative commons zero license or a variation of it. Here are some of the sites that offer you images for commercial use for free.

### 1\. Pexels

![pexels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-2.jpg)

Pexels.com is a free-to-use provider of high-resolution photos and videos for aspiring creators. The German-based website was started in 2014 by two brothers and has been under the Canva umbrella since 2018.

Currently, the website hosts over 3.2 million images and videos from over 250,000 active contributors. In addition, all the material you find in its library is under the Pexels license, which slightly varies from the creative commons zero license model. Some of the restrictions it enforces include:

* You can only use pexels images for commercial use after making alterations to the original image. For example, you can use part of an image to create a collage for your commercial branding.
* Furthermore, you cannot use any of the website's content to promote political ideologies and explicit content, especially if the images contain identifiable subjects.

Pexels is available through the following channels:

* Your web browser by typing the URL pexels.com.
* The Android and iOS app.
* A plugin for other content creation software such as Google Slides and MS Office.
* An extension on your Chrome browser.
* You can also access the database using the official Canva app.

### 2\. Unsplash

![unsplash](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-3.jpg)

Another website that offers free images for commercial use is Unsplash, a subsidiary of Getty Images since 2021\. The website is a favorite among creators boasting over 16 billion photo impressions monthly. In addition, the database consists of over 3.48 million photos from more than 265,000 unique contributors, all under the Unsplash license.

The Unsplash license restricts the sale of its creative assets without incorporating new creative elements, including using them in print media and physical goods such as mugs and caps.

You can access Unsplash from your web browser or request API integration for your application from the site's owners. In addition, the site also hosts photo walks across different cities, where Unsplash guides show you the best photo locations around the city and the best camera techniques for your work. Some cities to host the event include Boston, Montreal, Tokyo, and Toronto.

### 3\. Freerange

![freerange](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-4.jpg)

Freerange Stock is an online resource for photos, illustrations, and textures you can download and use for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Since 2007, the site has continued to provide high-quality images to its community of over 800,000 registered users.

Unlike the previous examples, all content on Freerange falls under the website's Equalicense. It grants you broad commercial rights of its stock images while allowing the contributors to retain control of their copyright, image resale, and distribution. As such, you cannot use the images for bulk distribution or print-on-demand works.

Freerange Stock maintains its steady supply of images for commercial use via the following methods:

* It has an in-house team of professional photographers who upload images across the different categories on the website.
* Freerange Stock also purchases image rights or directly commissions photos from independent creators.
* You can also contribute to the website's library by voluntarily submitting your work to the platform. Kindly note that you will need a verified account to enable this function.
* The website also works directly with photographers through a licensing and distribution model, providing them extra exposure on the site.
* Finally, Freerange stock aggregates public domain images from other sources, including similar sites and government institutions. It does so by acknowledging the image owner and sometimes lists the image source when the owner is unknown.

Freerange Stock is accessible through your web browser or as an API integration on your app.

### 4\. Vecteezy

![vecteezy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-5.jpg)

Vecteezy is an extensive online library of free stock images for commercial use. Some of the site's highlight features include the following:

* A best-in-class search engine that incorporates multiple filters to ensure your results are extremely accurate. For example, you can sort images by color, style, number of people, and age of the subjects, something other free stock websites do not provide.
* All images, videos, and vector illustrations are free for personal and commercial uses. It does so through a property sign and release model with its extensive network of contributors, which protects users from any legal liabilities.
* Finally, it employs a content team that manually reviews each photo submission to ensure consistent quality standards for its offerings.

In addition, you can also purchase design resource bundles by subscribing to its Vecteezy pro for as little as $9 monthly. Some of the resources available include the Ultimate Text Effects Layer Styles Bundle for Photoshop, which costs $39 stand-alone or $4.50 when you subscribe to pro.

## Part 2: Buy from stock providers

Another way to get images for commercial use is by buying them from stock providers. Some of the benefits of buying images from stock providers include:

* You get a wide selection of unique photos from top-tier photographers. Stock providers always seek collaborations with the industry's finest to edge out the competition.
* You receive exemplary customer service with your purchase. Selecting the right image can be confusing for amateur creators. As such, stock image providers have customer support channels to help you throughout your creative process.
* Stock images reduce your delivery times significantly. Buying images from a stock provider eliminates the need to invest in photography equipment and the time you need for post-production. As such, you can deliver projects in a fast and cost-effective way.

Despite the above positive, here are some challenges that buying stock images may present:

* Not all stock image providers will have the creative assets you need.
* Image overuse is likely since every creator will rush for the most popular contributor.

Below are some of the stock image providers you should consider.

### 1\. iStock

iStockphoto.com is an online database of creative resources, including royalty-free photos, videos, audio, illustrations, and clip art you can use in your creations. The website is a Getty Images subsidiary based in Calgary, Canada. In addition, contributors earn royalties depending on how often users download their content.

### 2\. Alamy.com

Alamy.com is a British-owned stock image provider with contributions from photographers and agencies in 173 countries. It compensates its contributors by offering higher than average payouts every time users download their creations. Some popular brands to use Alamy's services include M&C Saatchi, Microsoft, and The Economist.

## Part 3: Shot a Photo by yourself or create one with editing tools

Alternatively, you can get images for commercial use by shooting them yourself or creating them with editing tools such as Figma and Wondershare's Filmstock. Here are some benefits of using this method:

* You get exactly what you want, provided you have the required skills and equipment. Sometimes, getting the right image for your commercial purpose can be challenging. As such, shooting an original photo may be the only option.
* You have full ownership of the image.

Unlike obtaining images from stock photography websites, you are free to use the image in whatever capacity you please without any restrictions. For example, sites such as Unsplash do not allow you to use their images in political statements, a restriction you can bypass when using your own creations.

However, you should also consider the following factors when using this method.

### It requires a substantial investment

Getting high-quality images for commercial purposes requires specialist equipment. For example, the Panasonic LUMIX GH6 camera, which has 4K resolution capability, costs $2,197 on Amazon. This makes it extremely expensive for amateur creators.

### There is a steep learning curve

Becoming a professional photographer takes time and effort. Unless you are creating as a hobby, it will be a while before you can start generating income from your creations.

## Part 4: FAQs

### 1\. Do you need a contributor account to get images for commercial use?

Not necessarily. Stock image sites like pexels.com allow you to download images from their website without creating an account. You will only need one if you want to showcase your work on the platform.

### 2\. Can you use your smartphone to get images for commercial use?

Yes. Most stock image providers have device-specific apps that allow you to access their databases from your mobile device. For example, UnsplashPhotoPicker allows you access to the Unsplash library from your Android device.

## Part 1: What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization refers to algorithms that remove undesirable camera tremors and jitters caused by hand jiggling and the unintended camera panning to improve video quality.

Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image/video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.

Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.

It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie's transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.

## Part 1: What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization refers to algorithms that remove undesirable camera tremors and jitters caused by hand jiggling and the unintended camera panning to improve video quality.

Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image/video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.

Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.

It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie's transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.
