## Master Video Editing on Mac with MKVtoolnix: A Step-by-Step Guide 2023

# MKVtoolnix for Mac: An Easy Editing Application for All Mac Users

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

MKVtoolnix is a very useful application that enables you to create, alter, split, join, and inspect MKV files. And thank goodness that it’s also available for Mac OS X. But to be frank, its interface comes on rather a difficult side and maybe too complex for novice users to interpret.

Then is there any good program similar to MKVtoolnix but comes more intuitive interface? Absolutely.

[Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a professional video editing software with a rich number of features. This program provides nearly everything necessary for working with your MKV video files.

From basic video editings like Rotate, Trim, Crop, Flip, Split, Cut, etc. to advanced touchups like intro/credits, transitional effects, titles, visual filters, and more. Try this one-of-a-kind video editing tool now.

Check the video tutorial about how to edit videos on Mac first.
