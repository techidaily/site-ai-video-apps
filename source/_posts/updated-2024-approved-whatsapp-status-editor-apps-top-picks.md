The process of swapping faces with this cross-platform app developed by Microsoft is automatic, so you just have to snap a quick selfie, find the picture of a celebrity or anyone else you’d like to swap faces with and let the app do the rest for you. To make things even better, you can swap multiple faces in a single photo, as the Face Swap app automatically finds faces in pictures and places a new face over them. However, the results you will be able to get won’t necessarily be perfect each and every time, so you have to arm yourself with patience and keep trying until you create an image you feel confident sharing on social media.
