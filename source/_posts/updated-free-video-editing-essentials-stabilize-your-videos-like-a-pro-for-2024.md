As per research, audio plays a more vital role than the visuals in a video. Yes, no one will ever like a video that gets the audio track unrelated to the moving clip or has no voice. Similarly, suppose you are shooting or recording a live video. In that case, the most off-putting factors like **background noise**, **improper microphone**, and various distractions from the environment can affect the video or the movie quality.

Even if you perform recording in a proper studio, slight background noise can sneak into your video. So, tuning the voice or removing it is mandatory. If you are a Mac user, you can use the FCP noise removal to accomplish the task with no other third-party assistance. Please take a look at our today’s article to know **how to get rid of background noise in Final Cut Pro**. Alongside, you can also get to know some noise reduction plugins for FCPX.
