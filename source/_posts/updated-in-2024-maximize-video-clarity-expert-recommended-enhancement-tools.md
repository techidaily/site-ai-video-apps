Premiere Pro CC enables you to turn the raw footage captured by any camera in any format into awe-inspiring videos. Besides offering superb video editing options that include powerful color correction tools and amazing effects, the software also offers a decent amount of audio editing options.

The only downside is that Premiere Pro CC is not best suited for inexperienced video editors, and it takes quite some time to master all of its features.

#### **_6._**[**_Vegas Pro_**](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/)

**Price:**$399.00

What's more, in 2017, the software won the Emmy Award for pioneering digital non-linear editing. Lightworks has been one of the industry's best video enhancers for nearly thirty years, offering groundbreaking features to cinema professionals adore.

This video editing software lets you do virtually anything if you know how to do it. Multicam editing, a rich selection of effects, or support for a wide array of video file formats make Lightworks an excellent choice for skilled video editing professionals.

Even though the free version of the software is available, buying a monthly or annual license is a much better option if you want to approach your next project professionally.

#### **_8._**[**_Final Cut Pro X_**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Price:** $249.99

Besides providing support for 360-degree videos, Final Cut Pro also offers 360-degree graphics and effects.

The video editor is built on a 64-bit, enabling users to work on highly demanding projects. However, it is best to check the system requirements before installing it on your Mac computer. Final Cut Pro is unsuitable for beginners in video editing because using most of its features requires an enviable amount of skill.

#### **_Conclusion_**
