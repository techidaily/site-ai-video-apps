### 1\.  TikTok

**Available for:** Android, iOS, iPad

[TikTok](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok-make-your-day/id835599320) is a Chinese video-making and sharing social networking application used to create short dances, lip syncs, comedy and talent recordings, and much more. The introduction of the reaction feature in Tiktok enables the users to make and share their opinions about a particular event without leaving the application, therefore attracting more users even from other social media platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.

![Make Reaction Video with TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-reaction-video-maker-app.jpg)

To record a reaction, you can begin playing the video, tap the **Share** icon to open the menu and tap the **React** option. With this, Tiktok presents you with a video creation screen that allows you to add audio, change the position of the reaction box, and then record a video using your smartphone’s rear or front camera. You can add filters and [edit the volume level](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and then publish your reaction to the platform as needed.

**Pros**

* TikTok is free to use
* The app is available for both iOS and Android platforms

**Cons**

* Doesn’t allow videos that are of more than 60 seconds for normal users
* Limited in monetizing currently

### 2\.  iMovie

**Available for:** iOS, iPad and macOS

Developed by and proprietary of Apple Inc., [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193) is a simple post-production program for amateurs, and in some cases, even for [professional video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The software is available for both Mac computers and iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad and has almost all the features and functions required to edit and manipulate the videos to bring the best out of them.

Although not particularly a reaction video maker app, iMovie can be used to create plenty of them by recording your footage on your smartphone, downloading the source videos from TikTok, transferring both the clips to your Mac computer with iMovie installed (or installing iMovie on your iOS device if you are OK comfortable with the version), doing some basic editing tasks, downloading and importing the pre-keyed effects, adding them to your reaction project, and then exporting the final reaction in your preferred format.

**Pros**

* iMovie is a free program and can be downloaded from the App Store on your Mac computer or iPhone/iPad

**Cons**

* Not a full-fledged post-production program with all the robust features to work with.

### 3\.  Reaction & Screen Recorder

**Available for:** iOS

Designed by the employees of Spotify, [Reaction & Screen Recorder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reaction-cam/id1225289579) allows you to create reaction videos on iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad. In addition to this, the app even enables you to edit their recording with its built-in video editor.

![Make Reaction Video with Raction Cam](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reaction-cam-app-making-reaction-video.jpg)

Furthermore, equipped with all the interesting features, this mobile app lets you react to YouTube video, screen recordings of games, Facebook and Instagram videos, websites, online photos, and even to TikTok and other footage on your smartphone. Apart from this, you can pause and [rewind clips](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and record commentary videos as well.

**Pros**

* Fast rendering process
* Inbuilt effects and transitions

**Cons**

* Available exclusively for iOS platforms

![Make Reaction Video with iReact](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ireact-app-making-reaction-video.jpg)

The program lets you choose random footage from the Camera Roll to react on. You can even react to any online video by entering its URL. With iReact, you can record intros as well where the app lets you capture self-introduction before the actual clip. This structure is widely popular among the YouTube community.

As an added advantage, options like replay, pause, resume, rewind, and [fast-forward](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) come in handy as you can perform all these tasks while the camera records your reaction.

Many people from various video-sharing platforms use iReact as it is a widely popular reaction video maker app among iOS users across the globe.

**Pros**

* Users can resize and reposition the videos

**Cons**

* Users have to purchase the app in order to use advanced features

### 5\.  Reactoo

**Available for:** iOS

This reaction video app allows you to earn while creating reactions. Because brands look for people with a high number of likes and comments, [Reactoo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reactoo/id1177583261) acts as a bridge between you and companies by simplifying the process of earning money on the basis of sponsorship.

![Make Reaction Video with Reactoo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reactoo-app-making-reaction-video.jpg)

With Reactoo, you can also share your reaction videos on social networks like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. However, although the program is available only for iOS devices like iPhone and iPad, offers a simple interface that allows you to create stunning videos on your mobile devices.

**Pros**

* Enables collaboration with brands and earn in real-time
* Users can share videos on their social networks

**Cons**

* Regular and consistent posting is required to earn
* Available only for iOS devices

**Conclusion**

The best reaction video app comprises various features and tools that can be used to record the footage, edit them, add music, apply filters, and even control the playback of the clips. Thanks to all the advanced technologies and smart development team that have come up with such robust programs that are not only capable of capturing your reactions, they also let you publish them on your favorite social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. for the audience.

## Part 2: FAQ about Education Animation Software

### 1\. How do you make an educational animation video?

If you have set out to make an animation as a teaching aid, then you need the correct type of educational animation software to get you started. Up there with the greats are Renderforest, who let you make tutorials in child-friendly, fun fashion, and Filmora which features all sorts of other plugins to allow you to tailor the suite that you need.

Using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can replace After Effects, work with a Mac to edit footage, or create animations. There are limitless possibilities with this program – but it does let you create educational animation software pieces that will satisfy even the perfectionists out there.

### 2\. Why is the animation used in education?

The Institute of Progressive Education estimates several reasons why animation helps children learn better. At an early age, the bright color and bold shapes of cartoons help us develop recognition, understand words, and even tell time.

As we grow up, animation triggers the centers of the brain that work best for visual learning. When we insert a moral into a cartoon, it is also more often remembered because of the visuals. It is like the difference between seeing a film and reading a summary of the film.

Educational Animation Software is the tool we use to help create educational animations. It is playing more and more of a role in the teaching world, the deeper we go into the digital age.

### 3\. What are the benefits of using animation in teaching and learning of science subjects?

Animation allows students to develop their understanding by applying rational thinking to their imagination.

Educational Animation software has an especially important place in the teaching of science because it will enable children to understand what is going on at a microscopic level.

It does this by recreating things that cannot be seen by the naked eye. There was a study into this in the Journal of Life Science Education, which focused on cell biology education.

By showing cell mitosis in a cartoon, the teachers can communicate actions that they would never get to see.

### 4\. What makes a good educational video?

**Instructive recordings** have become a significant piece of advanced education, giving a significant substance conveyance device in many flipped, mixed, and online classes.

Successful utilization of video as an instructive device is improved when educators think about three components: how to deal with a psychological heap of the video, how to boost understudy commitment with the video, and how to advance dynamic gaining from the video.

This exposition audits writing applicable to every one of these standards and proposes viable ways educators can utilize these standards when using video as an instructive device.

All three components together answer the question of how to make animated educational videos.

### 5\. Which animation software is best for beginners?

Irrespective of whether these are just your initial steps in the field of animation, it is important to experiment.

So, knowing about alternative software or better ones from what you are using now is much required. You can also look for software that may bring in more versatility to your work. There are always different ways of improving what you are already doing.

Some of the [best animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) includes Adobe character animator, Cartoon Animator 4, Stop Motion Studio, DigiCel FlipBook, Moho Pro, and Moho Debut, Toon Boom Harmony, Blender, Pencil2D, Synfig Studio, Animaker, Vyond, Moovly, Wideo, and more.

## Part 2: FAQ about Education Animation Software

### 1\. How do you make an educational animation video?

If you have set out to make an animation as a teaching aid, then you need the correct type of educational animation software to get you started. Up there with the greats are Renderforest, who let you make tutorials in child-friendly, fun fashion, and Filmora which features all sorts of other plugins to allow you to tailor the suite that you need.

Using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can replace After Effects, work with a Mac to edit footage, or create animations. There are limitless possibilities with this program – but it does let you create educational animation software pieces that will satisfy even the perfectionists out there.

### 2\. Why is the animation used in education?

The Institute of Progressive Education estimates several reasons why animation helps children learn better. At an early age, the bright color and bold shapes of cartoons help us develop recognition, understand words, and even tell time.

As we grow up, animation triggers the centers of the brain that work best for visual learning. When we insert a moral into a cartoon, it is also more often remembered because of the visuals. It is like the difference between seeing a film and reading a summary of the film.

Educational Animation Software is the tool we use to help create educational animations. It is playing more and more of a role in the teaching world, the deeper we go into the digital age.

### 3\. What are the benefits of using animation in teaching and learning of science subjects?

Animation allows students to develop their understanding by applying rational thinking to their imagination.

Educational Animation software has an especially important place in the teaching of science because it will enable children to understand what is going on at a microscopic level.

It does this by recreating things that cannot be seen by the naked eye. There was a study into this in the Journal of Life Science Education, which focused on cell biology education.

By showing cell mitosis in a cartoon, the teachers can communicate actions that they would never get to see.

### 4\. What makes a good educational video?

**Instructive recordings** have become a significant piece of advanced education, giving a significant substance conveyance device in many flipped, mixed, and online classes.

Successful utilization of video as an instructive device is improved when educators think about three components: how to deal with a psychological heap of the video, how to boost understudy commitment with the video, and how to advance dynamic gaining from the video.

This exposition audits writing applicable to every one of these standards and proposes viable ways educators can utilize these standards when using video as an instructive device.

All three components together answer the question of how to make animated educational videos.

### 5\. Which animation software is best for beginners?

Irrespective of whether these are just your initial steps in the field of animation, it is important to experiment.

So, knowing about alternative software or better ones from what you are using now is much required. You can also look for software that may bring in more versatility to your work. There are always different ways of improving what you are already doing.

Some of the [best animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) includes Adobe character animator, Cartoon Animator 4, Stop Motion Studio, DigiCel FlipBook, Moho Pro, and Moho Debut, Toon Boom Harmony, Blender, Pencil2D, Synfig Studio, Animaker, Vyond, Moovly, Wideo, and more.

## Conclusion

There are a plethora of educational animation apps and sites that help the students to make their video presentations interesting and exciting. They do not just enjoy creating animation for educational purposes but also use it as a tool to enhance their creative ability and share their creations on the global platform.
