### 04**OffMP3**

**Price**: Free

Next on our list is OFFMP3\. It is, much like the other tools we've introduced thus far, an online video converter tool! This one, however, just like Intasaved, is a lot more obscure than the first two that we introduced. And thus, a little more limited.

| Features                                                                  | Limits                                                                    |

### 05**4ins**

**Price**: FREE

Despite the name, 4in's Instagram to MP4 converter does work for converting Instagram posts into MP3 files as well (as is shown in the image below). It's not the most advanced converter tool out there. But it does work, and it requires no download or installation.

| Features                                                                                                                 | Limits                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● Free to use ● Online video converter, no download or installation needed ● Available conversion formats: .mp4 and .mp3 | ● For online use only ● Limited conversion formats ● No quality control |
