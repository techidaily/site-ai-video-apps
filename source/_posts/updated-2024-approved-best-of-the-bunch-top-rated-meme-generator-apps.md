Choosing a meme generator is not easy because there are simply too many great apps for both iOS and Android devices that let you have complete control over the entire process of generating a meme. We've selected the 12 best options that are currently available on GooglePlay and AppStore.

#### 1. [GATM Meme Generator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=iddqd.gatm)

**Compatibility:** Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/GATM-meme-generator-android-app.jpg)

Besides being a powerful meme generator this app also offers an easy way to discover new memes. The browsable content is updated daily, so you'll always be in touch with the latest meme trends.

The app features a huge template library, and you can upload your own images too. The GATM Meme Generator can be downloaded for free, but the text formatting tools offer only basic options. All generated memes are watermark-free and they can be shared on Facebook, Twitter, or numerous other social media platforms directly from the app.

#### 2. [Mematic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.trilliarden.mematic&hl=en)

**Compatibility:** Android, iOS

![Meme Maker App](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mematic> -the-meme-maker.jpg)

Over 100.000 installs on Google Play show just how good this meme generator really is. Mematic is designed to create memes quickly and effortlessly, so you can just add captions and share the meme with your friends.

The app only offers basic text formatting tools, and there are no photo editing options. However, downloading Mematic for free will enable you to gain access to hundreds of classic meme pictures to which you can add your captions. The app's interface is intuitive so you won't have any problems making memes, even if you never used the Mematic app before.

#### 3. [Memedroid](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/memedroid-funny-memes-gifs/id549014460?mt=8)

Memedroid is both a meme generator and a community of people who enjoy a good laugh. It features a rich meme template library and just basic text tools. There are very few extra features other than support for uploading your own images and GIFs.

Despite this, the Memedroid app is a great source of new meme templates because the gallery is constantly updated. If you decide to install this app on your device, be prepared to deal with annoying ads on a regular basis. Don't be too surprised if the app crashes while you are browsing through the latest memes.

#### 4. [ZomboDroid's Meme Generator Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zombodroid.MemeGenerator&hl=en)

**Compatibility** **:** Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ZomboDroid-meme-generator-free.jpg)

Neatly organized memes into separate categories, stickers, excellent file sharing features, and memes without watermarks are only a few reasons why the Meme Generator Free app is so popular. As its name suggests, you don't have to pay anything to install the app and use its library that has over 700 memes.

You can choose the size of the header and footer, use a font you like, or crop images in just a few easy steps. The only unpleasant thing about this app is the ads because every other option makes the meme-generating process fun.

#### 5. [Tumblr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tumblr)

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tumblr-make-memes.jpg)

Tumblr is a social network, so you can create an account and post images and videos on your profile. The app for iPhones and Android Smartphones features a GIF editor as well as photo editing options. You can customize text by selecting the font, the size and the color or add as many stickers as you want to your memes.

Besides memes, you can use Tumblr to discover all types of images from pet photos to cars or fashion photos. All memes must be first posted to this social network before they can be shared on your other social media channels.

#### 6. [ZomboDroid's Video and GIF Memes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zombodroid.videogifmemefreegplay&hl=en)

**Compatibility:** Android

The coolest memes are always GIFs, and if you want a powerful app that lets you manipulate moving and still images then ZomboDroid's Video and GIF Memes is one of the best options. You can customize the text in any way you want while the app also lets you combine videos, GIFs, and photos into a single file.

The library contains millions of GIFs you can freely use to create your own hilarious memes. You can control the frame rate, speed or repetition of each GIF you edit with this incredibly fun app.

#### 7. [Meme Creator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gentoozero.memecreator)

**Compatibility:** Android

Curate your own collection of memes or create new memes using the Meme Creator's rich library that contains over 600 memes. The color of the captions and their size can be easily adjusted to meet your aesthetic demands. There are more than 20 different fonts available and you can also combine memes to create comics.

Meme Creator lets you share memes on all popular online destinations, which makes it a great choice for all Android owners who post fresh content every day on multiple social media profiles.

#### 8. [Meme Producer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meme-producer-free-meme-maker-generator/id560797323?mt=8)

**Compatibility:** iOS

Share memes in three simple steps. Choose a picture, add a caption and share a meme on any popular social media platform. Meme Producer lets you combine several images in a single meme and enables you to change a caption with a single tap.

Captions generated with this app can have more than one line, which is great if the text you want to add contains more than two sentences. The app can be downloaded for free from the AppStore and it contains no ads or watermarks.

#### 9. [Modern Meme Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dinizthiagobrdev.ModernMemeMaker)

**Compatibility:** Android

The app lets you browse and use over 200 free meme templates. You just have to select the meme you like and decide which color or the size the text is going to be. You don't have to worry about the length of the caption because the multi-line feature is available.

If you want, you can add watermarks to memes, although watermarked memes are not particularly popular. The best part is that Modern Meme Maker supports Instagram's upload requirements, while it also lets you share memes on Twitter or Tumblr.

#### 10. [Make a Meme +](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/make-a-meme+/id513930217?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Compatibility:** iOS

With more than 4 million users and an extensively long list of memes, this app is among the very best meme generators for iPhones. Changing the text requires you to just tap on a meme you like, while you can also add faces or hats to images you're editing.

The text formatting tools are not as powerful as you'd expect from an app that offers so many other cool features. All images can either be saved to the camera roll or shared on Facebook, Instagram, and other popular online destinations.

---

#### **Conclusion:**

Making a meme is about imagination, and having a sense of humor, but you also need a powerful tool that lets you express your ideas in the exact way you want. A good meme generator app will help you forget about the technical side of the meme-making process so you can focus on what is truly important. What's your favorite meme generator app for iOS or Android devices? Wanna be more creative in making memes and level up your video editing experience, download Filmora for free and make memes and videos with fun.

Making a meme is about imagination, and having a sense of humor, but you also need a powerful tool that lets you express your ideas in the exact way you want.

A box will pop up at the bottom of the screen; this is referred to as the Timeline, and it's where the different pieces you're adding to the video will appear, including images layers, text layers, and video clips.

![how to trim video using kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-3.png)

### Step 5

Your video plays from the left side to the right side. The Play icon allows you to play the video and preview your project. Use the seeker to go to any point of your video that you want to see how it will look like.

### Step 6

If you want more precision while editing individual video clips in the Timeline, use the Zoom In and Zoom out buttons to see a more precise view.

![a guide to trim video using kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-5.png)

### Step 7

To trim the video, click the Trim button.

![trim video with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-6.png)

Click and drag the ends of your video to adjust the end and start times of the video layer. Anything that you remove won't be in the final video.

![steps to trim video with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-7.png)

If you have more layers on your project, click and select the layer you would like to trim.

### Step 8

You can also use the Timing tab to trim your video. To do this, click your clip and head over to the top right side of your screen.

![use timing to trim video with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-8.png)

You can now specify the exact time you would like the video to start and end instead of using the clicking and dragging method.

![use timing to trim video with kapwing - set time range](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-9.png)

Clicking the numerals will allow you to use the up and down arrow keys and trim the video to start and end where you have specified.

You can also use the seeker to set the time where you would like the video to start and end, and then go to the numerals and click set to the current time.

Kapwing Video Trimmer will create a huge gap when you select this option. You'll see a blank white canvas until the video starts.

You can leave this white space and add other clips or remove it so that your video starts at zero by clicking it and hitting the Delete key on your keyboard.

### Step 9

Once you have finished trimming your video with Video Trimmer Kapwing, click the Export Video button.

![export trim vieo in kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-10.png)

You'll have to sign in to remove the watermark. Click the Download button to download the trimmed video to your device.

## Extra Information About Kapwing Editor

Now that you know how to trim videos with Kapwing Video Trimmer let's look at five things about this online editing tool that you need to know.

#### 1\. You Can Cut and Split Parts of Your Videos

With the Kapwing Video Editing tool, you can cut out the middle of your video clip by using the split key. You only need to drag the seeker to where you would like to cut out, then click the Split button. Doing this will turn the original video clip into two clips that you drag to trim down any part that you do not want to appear in your video.

#### 2\. How to Collaborate With Kapwing

Kapwing allows you to work as a group remotely and in real-time while accessing each other's files. The tool is also ideal for teams, outsourced workers, and virtual assistants. All you have to do is invite your peers or colleagues to a Workspace, and Kaping will allow you to work together on GIF, video, and image edits.

To share your Kapwing Workspace to collaborate with other users without giving them your log-in information, follow the steps below.

* Simply go to the folder you would like to share and hit the Share button.
* You'll then have to type in the email address of the person you want to share the folder with.
* Once you have done this, click the Send Invite button to copy and send a link to an invitation to your folder.

Your collaborator needs to open the email with the link and click Join Now. They'll also have to create an account by linking their Facebook or Google account and then accept the invite again once they have signed in.

#### 3\. You Can Add Audio and Text to Your Video

Kapwing editor allows you to add audio and text using two methods: subtitles and text boxes. Use single text boxes for information, names, titles, and labels. To do this, hit the Text button located in the upper toolbar, then enter the text you want into the box.

All the text editing options will appear on the right, including angle, position, style, outline, color, and font. The Anime tab allows you to add up to 10 different animations to the text box. Additionally, you can add subtitles to your videos if you want your audience to follow along while listening to the spoken words in the video.

#### 4\. Share Your Videos With Others

After creating your video project, you can share it with others from the download page. You can share your video directly on Instagram. Twitter, and Facebook. You can also copy the video's link and then send it to anyone you want, and they will be able to view it.
