#### 2. Split AVI files with one click

 Highlight the video, and drag the slidebar in the previewing window to go to the point where you want to split. Click "Pause" abd hit the scissor icon in the toolbar to split your AVI clip into two parts.

 Now get rid of the unwanted part by simply hitting "Delete" on your keyboard.

 Tip: You can click the Timeline Zoomer for precise location and video editing.

#### 3. Save the split AVI file

 When you get your wanted AVI segment, click "Create" to access the output window. Here, you can choose a video format like AVI, WMV, MOV, MP4, etc. to save on your computer. Or export directly to your device by picking the optimized preset. If you want to share your creation on YouTube, just go for the option.
