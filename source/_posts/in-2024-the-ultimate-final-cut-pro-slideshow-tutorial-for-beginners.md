#### 1\.  How to create a glitch transition with Filmora?

If you are using Filmora X V10.5 and the later versions, you can now find the glitch transitions in the program. To locate the glitch transition, type glitch in the transition search bar and you will find all glitch-related transitions in the library, such as VHS and glitch effect, retro game intro pack transition, and VFX cyberpunk pack transition.

![Filmora Glitch transitions ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-glitch-transitions.jpg)

However, there are no glitch transitions in Filmora’s transition library if you are running versions before V10.5, you can use the Chromatic Aberration effect for this purpose.

All you need to do is to place two different video clips onto the timeline and then go to the Effects tab. Expand the Filters menu and click on the Distortion submenu. The Chromatic Aberration effect is located near the top of the tab, so just drag and drop it to the video track that is directly above the one to which you added the footage.

![Filmora Glitch  effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-chromatic-aberration-glitch-effects.jpg)

You should then reduce the effect’s duration to six or eight frames, and you can enlarge the timeline to perform this task with more precision. Once you’ve adjusted the duration of the effect, you should place it above the cut, so that it covers the last four frames of the ending video clip and the first two frames of the video clip that is starting.

[Adding a sound effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that matches the glitch transition you created is going to draw the viewer’s attention to the transition and make it more realistic.

#### 2\. How to add the glitch effect to text in Filmora?

The process of adding a glitch effect to text is simple, although you need to go through several different steps. You should start by choosing one of the available titles from Filmora’s Title tab and placing it on the timeline.

Double-click on the title you added, then click on the Advanced button and insert the text into the textbox. Proceed to set the text color to white, adjust its size and select a new font and then make sure that the No Animation option is selected in the Animation tab.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 Click OK to confirm the changes you’ve made, then lock the video track on which the title is located, copy the title to the video track above and unlock the video track you locked. Once you’ve created the second title, you should double-click on the first title and change the text color to black.

Make a cut at two seconds on the title you copied and then head over to the Transition tab to locate the Deposit Up transition. Drag the Deposit Up transition from the Transition tab and drop it over the beginning of the title you copied. Export this title from Filmora as a video and then import it back into your project.

Remove the titles you added to the timeline and proceed to place the footage on the timeline. Afterward, you should place the video clip you created directly above the first video and match their durations. Double-click on the video clip that contains text and change the Blending Mode to Lighten from the Compositing menu.

Proceed to add the Shake, Flip, and Chromatic Aberration effects to the overlaying clip and then go to the Video Effects menu that is located in the Video tab to adjust the settings of the effects you applied.

#### 3\. How to apply a glitch effect to a video with Filmora?

The fastest way to apply a glitch effect in Filmora to a video clip is to add the Chromatic Aberration effect to it. Combining the Chromatic Aberration effect with filters, 3D LUTs and audio effects will help you sell the effect better.

Which combination of Filmora’s visual effects you are going to use, ultimately depends on the type of glitch effect you want to create. Optionally, you can also use keyframes to introduce the changes you make more gradually. Filmora offers you plenty of ways to get creative with glitch effects, but it is up to you to find the best way to incorporate glitch effects into your videos.

If you are using the Filmora V10.5 and later version, you can add the Human Glitch effect under AI Portrait category, which will leave the video background without glitch effects.

The Video Overlay settings, Clip Filter options as well as the Split Screen feature enable you to overlay video clips and simulate the glitch effect.

Creating a glitch effect with iMovie requires you to have excellent video editing skills, and quite a bit of creativity as you have to plan the entire effect in advance. Even so the video editing tools you will have at your disposal are going to be limited so you shouldn’t expect to achieve breathtaking results. Adding an audio effect that accompanies the glitch effect may make this effect look more realistic.

Simply expand the effect and click on the ON checkbox to apply an effect and then proceed to adjust its settings. Optionally, you can click on the Mosh button that is located below the Preview Screen if you want to combine two or more random glitch effects. The only downside is that you can only save your creations as JPEG, GIF, or WEBM files, and the videos you record in the WEBM format can last for a few seconds.

This template is customizable which enables you to upload the images you want to use and your tailored promotional message or alter the theme colors. You can also choose the soundtrack for the glitch video by simply uploading the song you want to use. However, if you opt for Biteable’s Starter pack you won’t be able to export more than one video per month.

You can only create three-minute videos at 360p resolution if you decide to use the free version of this platform, and all videos you export from Renderforest are going to be watermarked if you don’t purchase one of the available subscriptions models.

### 7. [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/)

**Price:** Free

Creating glitch videos with Shotcut is easy because this open-source video editor allows you to choose from several different glitch effects.

The RGB Shift is yet another effect you can use to create glitches in your videos. After you apply it to a video clip you can adjust the vertical and horizontal values, but keep in mind that setting both of these values to 50 is going to align them perfectly and render them invisible. Moreover, filters such as Shake, Old Film Projector, or Old Film Technicolor can all be used to simulate glitches in a video.

### 8. [VSDC](http://www.videosoftdev.com/)

**Price:** Free

Click on the Properties drop-down menu in the Glitch Effect Settings submenu and choose one of the available options or pick the Custom option if you want to create a new glitch effect preset.

### FAQ About Glitch Video Editors

A glitch effect can be any intervention you make on a video clip that makes that video look like it was recorded by a faulty camera or displayed on a malfunctioning display device.

We live in the digital age, which is the reason why the topic of malfunctioning electronics is close to us. Most of us have seen TV static, a monitor glitch, or some other fault of a display more than once, and it is hardly surprising that a growing number of filmmakers and video content creators refer to glitches in their work.

Glitches can be used in the opening titles, as transitions or effects that are applied to an entire video, but you need to fit them into the right context since glitches don’t match all styles of videos. You are at the right place if you want to find out more about glitch video editors because in this article we are going to introduce you to some of the best glitch video editors on the market.

#### 2\. How to add the glitch effect to text in Filmora?

 Click OK to confirm the changes you’ve made, then lock the video track on which the title is located, copy the title to the video track above and unlock the video track you locked. Once you’ve created the second title, you should double-click on the first title and change the text color to black.

Make a cut at two seconds on the title you copied and then head over to the Transition tab to locate the Deposit Up transition. Drag the Deposit Up transition from the Transition tab and drop it over the beginning of the title you copied. Export this title from Filmora as a video and then import it back into your project.

Remove the titles you added to the timeline and proceed to place the footage on the timeline. Afterward, you should place the video clip you created directly above the first video and match their durations. Double-click on the video clip that contains text and change the Blending Mode to Lighten from the Compositing menu.

Proceed to add the Shake, Flip, and Chromatic Aberration effects to the overlaying clip and then go to the Video Effects menu that is located in the Video tab to adjust the settings of the effects you applied.

#### 3\. How to apply a glitch effect to a video with Filmora?

The fastest way to apply a glitch effect in Filmora to a video clip is to add the Chromatic Aberration effect to it. Combining the Chromatic Aberration effect with filters, 3D LUTs and audio effects will help you sell the effect better.

Which combination of Filmora’s visual effects you are going to use, ultimately depends on the type of glitch effect you want to create. Optionally, you can also use keyframes to introduce the changes you make more gradually. Filmora offers you plenty of ways to get creative with glitch effects, but it is up to you to find the best way to incorporate glitch effects into your videos.

If you are using the Filmora V10.5 and later version, you can add the Human Glitch effect under AI Portrait category, which will leave the video background without glitch effects.

We live in the digital age, which is the reason why the topic of malfunctioning electronics is close to us. Most of us have seen TV static, a monitor glitch, or some other fault of a display more than once, and it is hardly surprising that a growing number of filmmakers and video content creators refer to glitches in their work.

Glitches can be used in the opening titles, as transitions or effects that are applied to an entire video, but you need to fit them into the right context since glitches don’t match all styles of videos. You are at the right place if you want to find out more about glitch video editors because in this article we are going to introduce you to some of the best glitch video editors on the market.

## The Best Glitch Video Editors \[Online & Desktop\]

Virtually any video editing software can be used to create a glitch effect, but you should keep in mind that only some video editors feature glitch effects in their effects libraries. Choosing a video editing software that already has preset glitch effects will make it easier for you to use these effects in different projects. Let’s take a look at some of the best glitch video editors.

### 1\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is a versatile video editor that enables you to do much more than just apply glitch effects to videos. In fact, it allows you to manipulate your footage in virtually any way you want by giving you access to huge titles, effects, and transitions libraries and allowing you to use a broad range of video editing tools. Filmora let's use glitch effects in all of your projects, so here’s how you can use glitch effects in videos you edit in Filmora.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1\.  How to create a glitch transition with Filmora?

If you are using Filmora X V10.5 and the later versions, you can now find the glitch transitions in the program. To locate the glitch transition, type glitch in the transition search bar and you will find all glitch-related transitions in the library, such as VHS and glitch effect, retro game intro pack transition, and VFX cyberpunk pack transition.

![Filmora Glitch transitions ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-glitch-transitions.jpg)

However, there are no glitch transitions in Filmora’s transition library if you are running versions before V10.5, you can use the Chromatic Aberration effect for this purpose.

All you need to do is to place two different video clips onto the timeline and then go to the Effects tab. Expand the Filters menu and click on the Distortion submenu. The Chromatic Aberration effect is located near the top of the tab, so just drag and drop it to the video track that is directly above the one to which you added the footage.

![Filmora Glitch  effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-chromatic-aberration-glitch-effects.jpg)

You should then reduce the effect’s duration to six or eight frames, and you can enlarge the timeline to perform this task with more precision. Once you’ve adjusted the duration of the effect, you should place it above the cut, so that it covers the last four frames of the ending video clip and the first two frames of the video clip that is starting.

[Adding a sound effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that matches the glitch transition you created is going to draw the viewer’s attention to the transition and make it more realistic.

## Ratio Refined: Expert Techniques for Image Sizing and Scaling

You might have noticed that earlier DVDs came with full screen or widescreen viewing choices. Moreover, when you choose the wrong option, it cuts off the movie parts, or the video gets surrounded by black padding.

The standard resolution of your screen stretched from a 4:3 aspect ratio to the wider one. So, producers started making movies that fit on both screens. After the standardization of aspect ratio display, broadcasters pay attention to the image ratio of clips.

So, below is the guide to find, calculate and adjust image ratio with a picture ratio calculator. Let's get started.

#### In this article

01 [What is the image ratio?](#Part 1)

02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

![Photoshop testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-2.jpg)

### Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation

You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window's system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.

To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

Image ratio is significant in the videography business. But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.

If you want to make permanent adjustments, use a convertor or editor. "Wondershare Filmora" is the best video editor that allows you to create videos with different aspect ratios and adjust these ratios easily.

02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

![Photoshop testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-2.jpg)

### Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation

You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window's system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.

To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

Image ratio is significant in the videography business. But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.

If you want to make permanent adjustments, use a convertor or editor. "Wondershare Filmora" is the best video editor that allows you to create videos with different aspect ratios and adjust these ratios easily.

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

### Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation

You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window's system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.

To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

Image ratio is significant in the videography business. But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.

If you want to make permanent adjustments, use a convertor or editor. "Wondershare Filmora" is the best video editor that allows you to create videos with different aspect ratios and adjust these ratios easily.
