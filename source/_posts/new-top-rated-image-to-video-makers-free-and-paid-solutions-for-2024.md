![toolbar stt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/guide-win/toolbar-stt.jpg)

If you're looking, specifically, for a clean method of doing so, then it's understandable if you're facing difficulty with finding the right one. There are many **speech-to-text** audio converters available.

However, not all of them are all that great in quality. In this article, we'll be introducing a couple of converters that you can use to change **audio to text** as well as show you how to do it

#### In this article

01 [Is There an App That Converts Voice Recording to Text?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert Audio to Text - FREE & No Time Limits](#Part 2)

03 [Best 6 Free Paid and Online Speech-to-text Software in 2022](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is There an App That Converts Voice Recording to Text?

Do apps that convert **speech to text** actually exist? The quick answer? Yes

Transcribe (shown in the image below), which is available for all iOS devices, is one such app. This tool, as you might be able to guess from the name, is able to transcribe spoken audio into text. It’s especially useful for creating notes (personal use), as it means you can have your thoughts written down in an instant without ever having to lift up a pen or type it down for yourself.

And, just to be very clear, there are many more **speech-to-text** apps like this one

![Transcribe - Speech to Text App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%201.png)

## Part 2 How to Convert Audio to Text - FREE & No Time Limits

For this next part, we’ll be introducing a variety of different methods that you can use to convert **audio to text**. From apps, software, online solutions, etc. There are plenty of ways, so you can find the one that works best for you

### 01Online Speech-to-Text — VEED.IO

The first and most common way to turn **speech-to-text**—especially for those who want something more accessible no matter what device they are on—is online **speech-to-text MP3** converters A great example of one of these online tools is the MP3 to text converter, VEED-IO. The key feature here is that you won’t have to download or install anything to start using it Also, VEED.IO (and many other online **speech-to-text** converters) is FREE.

![Online MP3 to Text Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%202.png)

### 02Windows Dictate

This next one is more of a live **audio-to-text** tool. Or rather, a live transcriber tool, but it can be useful despite the fact, especially since, once again, it is 100% free and FREE to use. What we’re talking about, in this case, is Windows Dictate. This is a built-in function for Windows OS users. It’s there to increase accessibility for those with vision impairment, but it’s also a great way of easily converting your **speech to text**.

![Windows - Speech | Dictate Feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%203.png)

### 03Smart Phone App - Transcribe

As mentioned earlier, there are apps out there that work in pretty much the same way. Another notable one, besides the app ‘Transcribe’ that we introduced earlier, is the iOS app called ‘Voice to Text Pro - Transcribe.’ This particular app offers advanced **speech-to-text** functionalities that will allow you to either transcribe live audio or upload an MP3 to transcribe. It also has support for over 150+ languages and has a convenient notes function for taking advantage of the transcription function.

![Voice-to-Text App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%204.png)

### 04Google Docs

Another 100% FREE method of getting live **speech** **to text** is Google Doc’s “Voice Typing” function. You can turn this on at any time by making use of the command ‘Ctrl+Shift+S’ or by turning it on manually from the ‘Tools’ tab on a Google Document (shown in the image below). It’s a very easy way of getting your thoughts onto paper while working on other things.

![Voice Typing Feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%205.png)

### 05Apple Dictation (iOS, iPadOS, macOS)

If you’re a Mac user, then the second item on this list was probably of not much use to you. But, don’t worry, Windows Dictates has a Mac/iOS counterpart It’s in the form of Apple Dictation Again, it was set up to increase accessibility for users with visual impairment, but it can be pretty useful as well for the times when your hands are too busy to actively type your thoughts down.

You can turn on this feature by going to your device’s ‘Accessibility’ settings and enabling ‘Voice Control’ (as is shown in the image below). It will need to be downloaded and installed onto your device, but it should begin working pretty quickly after that.

![apple Voice Control Features](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%206.png)

## Part 3 Best 6 Free, Paid, and Online Speech-to-text Software in 2022

For this next section, we’ll be introducing some other **speech-to-text** solutions. Specific ones this time though A URL for each tool will be provided, as well as a description of how each one works. It will be a mixed list, so expect both FREE & Paid solutions.

### 01Otter.ai

Otter.ai is an **audio-to-text** solution that is advertised as an automated notes-taking tool The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that is available for most devices (Mac, PC, tablets, smartphones, etc.) There is a FREE version of the software available as well. So, if you’d like to try it out before committing to it, that’s definitely possible

![ai Note-Taking Solution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%207.png)

### 02Watson Speech to Text

Watson **Speech-to-Text** is a FREEmium cloud-based **audio-to-text** converter that, much like Otter.ai, you can try for free It offers multi-language support. And is perfect for transcribing live audio for a more professional setting.

![Watson Speech to Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%208.png)

### 03Dragon Anywhere

Also, it comes in a software version (for desktops and laptops) and an app version (for tablets and smart devices). The price of this particular piece of software is high, but there’s no denying that it produces high-quality **speech-to-text**

![Dragon Anywhere Professional Dictation App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%209.png)

### 04Verbit - Transcription & Captioning

Our next pick, ‘Verbit’ is popular with content creators as it is marketed as both a transcription and captioning software (for adding subtitles or captions to video content). It is a FREEmium software as well as a more of a business solution. But that only means that you have access to more advanced features.

![Verbit Captioning and Transcription Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%2010.png)

### 05Amazon Transcribe

Finding ways to show your feelings isn’t always easy. In fact, [buying presents](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for those you care about the most, won’t necessarily reflect how you feel, so this year you can try making something for them.

**Creating a short Valentine’s Day video** shouldn’t be too hard, especially if you have a great story to tell. Besides, a video is something that will last, and your significant other will always be able to watch it no matter what the future brings. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to make a Valentine’s Day video on your Windows PC or Mac, or just with your mobile phones that will truly show how you feel.

## How to Make a Valentine’s Day Video on Windows and Mac

There are hundreds of [video editing software for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Mac computers you can use to create a Valentine’s Day video, but in this article, we are going to use Filmora as an example. However, each of the steps we will cover can be used in other video editors for Mac and Windows. Let’s check how to make a Valentine’s Day video with Filmora.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 1\. It all starts with an Idea

Creating any type of video without having a well-developed idea is virtually impossible because you won’t know which footage to use. Moreover, having an idea of how you want the final draft of the video to look will make it easier for you to select the footage you intend to use during the video editing process.

Once you know exactly what you want to do you can start shooting or collecting the footage you are going to include in your Valentine’s Day video. After you have all the video files you need, place them in one folder, launch Filmora, create a new project and proceed to import the footage by dragging and dropping the files to the editor’s Media tab.

### 2\. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors

During the next step, you should add all video clips you would like to use in your video to the timeline. You can do this by simply dragging a particular video file from the Media tab and dropping it to the desired location on the timeline.

![Drag and drop valentines video footage to Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-n-drop-timeline.jpg)

Optionally, you can use the Split tool to make cuts in a video clip and [remove parts you don’t want to include in the final version of the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). When done, you should right-click on each of the video clips you added to the timeline and select [the Color Correction](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) option. You can then proceed to fine-tune the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, or Highlights values depending on how bright or vivid the colors in the original video are. This process can take a while, which is why it is important to be patient and go through it slowly.

### 3\. Add Romantic Filters and Elements

Filmora features Effects and Elements libraries that contain hundreds of different image overlays, filters, and predesigned elements you can add to your project. You just need to click on the Effect or Elements icons in the upper right corner of the screen to start browsing these libraries.

![Drag and drop valentines element to video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-elements.jpg)

Once you find a romantic filter or element you want to apply to your footage, you should simply drag and drop it to the video track that is located directly above the one on which your footage is located. You should then position an [overlay, a filter, or an element](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at the exact spot where you want them to appear in your video.

![Drag and drop valentines transitions  to video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-transitions.jpg)

In case you want to adjust the intensity of an effect you applied you should just double-click on it and then use the Alpha slider to adjust the effect’s intensity. Double-clicking on an element you placed on the timeline will grant you access to the Video tab where you can rotate it, change its on-screen position, or set its Opacity value.

### 4\. Apply Text Layers

The Titles tab contains more than a hundred different Openers, End Credits, or Titles options you can use in all of your projects. Simply pick the one that best matches the style of your video, then add it to the timeline and double-click on it in order to start customizing it.

![Drag and drop valentines texts and titles  to video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-titles.jpg)

Once you [insert the text](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can pick the font, color, or this size of the text, as well as set the spacing between two lines of text. Optionally, you can use Filmora’s Advanced Text Edit window if you want to have complete control over all layers of text you add to your video.

### 5\. Create the Soundtrack

Music will give your video the rhythm and it will make it more entertaining to watch, which is the reason why you shouldn’t skip this step. In case, you already have an audio file you would like to use as a soundtrack for your Valentine’s Day video, you can import it into Fimora the same way you would import a video file. You can then add it to an audio track and adjust its duration so that it matches the duration of the entire video.

![add music for valentines video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-audio-library.jpg)

You can also use Filmora’s library of [royalty-free songs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create the soundtrack for the video you are making. Just head over to the Audio tab, pick a song from Electronic, Rock, or Tender & Sentimental categories, and add it to the timeline.

### 6\. Export the Video

When done with all these steps, you should preview the video you’ve created and if you like the results click on the Export button. You can then proceed to select the video format in which your video is going to be exported, choose the preferred resolution or the [frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Furthermore, Filmora lets you export all videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channels, which can save you a lot of time on uploading videos to these video hosting platforms. Nonetheless, how long the rendering process is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power.

## Creating Videos with Valentine Video Maker for Android

Finding ways to show your feelings isn’t always easy. In fact, [buying presents](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for those you care about the most, won’t necessarily reflect how you feel, so this year you can try making something for them.

**Creating a short Valentine’s Day video** shouldn’t be too hard, especially if you have a great story to tell. Besides, a video is something that will last, and your significant other will always be able to watch it no matter what the future brings. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to make a Valentine’s Day video on your Windows PC or Mac, or just with your mobile phones that will truly show how you feel.

## How to Make a Valentine’s Day Video on Windows and Mac

There are hundreds of [video editing software for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Mac computers you can use to create a Valentine’s Day video, but in this article, we are going to use Filmora as an example. However, each of the steps we will cover can be used in other video editors for Mac and Windows. Let’s check how to make a Valentine’s Day video with Filmora.

### 1\. It all starts with an Idea

Creating any type of video without having a well-developed idea is virtually impossible because you won’t know which footage to use. Moreover, having an idea of how you want the final draft of the video to look will make it easier for you to select the footage you intend to use during the video editing process.

Once you know exactly what you want to do you can start shooting or collecting the footage you are going to include in your Valentine’s Day video. After you have all the video files you need, place them in one folder, launch Filmora, create a new project and proceed to import the footage by dragging and dropping the files to the editor’s Media tab.

### 2\. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors

During the next step, you should add all video clips you would like to use in your video to the timeline. You can do this by simply dragging a particular video file from the Media tab and dropping it to the desired location on the timeline.

Optionally, you can use the Split tool to make cuts in a video clip and [remove parts you don’t want to include in the final version of the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). When done, you should right-click on each of the video clips you added to the timeline and select [the Color Correction](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) option. You can then proceed to fine-tune the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, or Highlights values depending on how bright or vivid the colors in the original video are. This process can take a while, which is why it is important to be patient and go through it slowly.
