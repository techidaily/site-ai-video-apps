When you’re an amateur filmmaker, then it’s essential to have affordable options for filmmaking software that can help you to achieve your goals. But, what types of options do you have that are going to fit in your budget? In this article, we’ll give you 7 different options for low-budget filmmaking software.

* [**Part 1: Film Editing Software to Edit Videos**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Filmmaking Software to Improve Workflow**](#part2)

## 6 Filmmaking Software You Need to Know

## Part 1: Film Editing Software to Edit Videos

### 1. Filmora Video Editor

Filmora - a video editor which has significantly improved overall performance, making the product faster, and more powerful, and taking the user editing experience to a new level.

It is perfect for helping beginners, and intermediate users create stylish videos by providing an intuitive user interface and built-in effects.

### 2. Vegas Pro

Vegas Pro is one of the most well-known budget options out there when it comes to video editing. It actually started out as editing software for audio (podcasts, radio shows, etc.), but then expanded over time. Because of those beginnings, many people have found that it is one of the best options you’ll have available when it comes to audio editing within a film. It’s also very versatile – you don’t need anything but a Windows PC in order to run it.

## Part 2: Filmmaking Software to Improve Workflow

### 2. StudioBinder

Keeping up with the production process takes a lot of work, and Studio Binder was specially designed to help you take care of those things more easily. From script breakdowns (which keep everyone in the loop as to what is next in filming) to lists where you keep track of what shots you’ve taken and which you need to take, it has everything you need to keep your entire team on track throughout the entire process of filming.

![StudioBinder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/StudioBinder.jpg)

### 3. Storyboarder

Keeping up with the story and everything around it during the filming process can take a lot of work. That’s why many filmmakers suggest putting together what is known as a storyboard – a rough draft of the storyline, put together in a fashion so that you can follow everything and check it all out properly. Storyboarder is a software package that helps you to visualize everything, check out if the story works, and keep up with your ideas (even if you get distracted during filming).

![Storyboarder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Storyboarder.jpg)

### 4. Adobe Audition

Sometimes, you need something that is a little more advanced and focused when it comes to putting together the sound mix in a way that is pleasing to the ears. Adobe Audition is one of the most popular options for this, because it has all of the tools necessary so that you can get the perfect balance and fullness of sound in your film. Your sound is just as important as your videography, so picking this up can be really helpful in the long run.

![Adobe Audition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audition.jpg)

### 5. Evernote

Organization is absolutely essential when you’re trying to put a film together and, because of that, you’re likely exploring a lot of different options that can help you to stay organized. Evernote is a lovely option and it’s available for computers and for phones/tablets, so you can take it anywhere with you. You can put together task lists, keep notes on what’s going on during the filming process, and more. It’s a really simple program to use and it’s quite easy to import and export info from it.

![Evernote](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Evernote.jpg)

### 6. Google Docs

Google Docs is part of the Google Suite, and it’s a smart word processing program that has all of the flexibility of programs like Microsoft Word. One of the biggest differences, however, is the ability to collaborate and work on the same document without the need to send it back and forth via email. Changes are updated in real time, so you can work on a document together, even if you aren’t in the same vicinity.

![Google Docs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Google-Docs.jpg)

## Conclusion

Do some research on the web and find the options that work best for your team’s budget and for how you plan on working on your films. You can find plenty of low-budget software that can help to make your film look great without breaking the budget you’ve set into place.

## Retro Revival: Top Apps for Adding VHS Filters to Your Mobile Videos

VHS references the Video Home System video capture format created by the Japanese corporation JVC. It was a big step forward for consumers at the time, putting the ability to record and replay the video at the disposal of the general people, and it swiftly expanded into most houses.

Anyone who has possessed an old camcorder knows that the quality of the films and photographs it took was far inferior to what we are accustomed to with newer camcorders. However, such retro cameras are no longer in use. But, you may still achieve the impression of antique images by using a **VHS app.** A few of the excellent ones are reviewed by this article. Let's get going!

## FCP X Essentials: How to Achieve Flawless Green Screen Effects

# FCP X: Create a Chroma-Key (Green-screen) Effect

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Chroma-key (also called "green screen") effects are a staple in video production. What [FCP X effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)does is allow you to make the background behind an actor transparent so you can place the actor into a different environment than a studio.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## Getting Started

First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:

* Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background "spilling" around their body or shoulders.
* In general, don't cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.
* The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.
* The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.
* There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.
* Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.
* Don't worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.

## Setting up the Key

![fx chroma 01](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg)

The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.

**Step 1: Select the green screen clip**

From the **Effects Browser > Keying** category, double-click the **Keyer** effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)

![fx chroma 02](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg)

Don't panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.

![fx chroma 03](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg)

Click the **Sample Color** icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.

![fx chroma 04](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg)

In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.

Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:

* Cleaning up the matte
* Edge adjustments
* Light wrap

![fx chroma 06](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg)

Click the **Matte** button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.

![fx chroma 07](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg)

Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the **Fill Holes** and **Edge Distance** sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you'll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)

![fx chroma 05](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg)

If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the **Edges** icon.

![fx chroma 09](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg)

**Step 2: Tweaks Video**

Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.

![fx chroma 09a](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg)

Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:

* Color Selection
* Matte Tools
* Spill Suppression
* Light Wrap

The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)

Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more "organic," as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.

This is a subtle effect, but very cool.

![fx chroma 10](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg)

Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.

![fx chroma 11](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-11.jpg)

When you are done, you have a great looking key!

## Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask

![fx chroma 12](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-12.jpg)

Sometimes, however, you don't have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)

Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there's one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.

![fx chroma 13](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg)

Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn't all that good – drag the Mask effect (**Effects > Keying > Mask**) on top of the green-screen clip.

**NOTE**: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.

![fx chroma 14](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg)

Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I've found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.

However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That's where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It's written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com/fcpx/ – I recommend his effects highly.

## How to Create a Chroma-Key in easier ways?

Chroma-key, or green screen, is an essential part of every editor to make all kinds of effects. Is there any way to make this sophisticated procedure easier way? Yes, try Filmora.

In version 10.5 for Mac, Filmora added a new feature: AI portrait. It allows you to do a green screen effect with just one click.

First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:

* Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background "spilling" around their body or shoulders.
* In general, don't cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.
* The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.
* The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.
* There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.
* Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.
* Don't worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.

## Setting up the Key

![fx chroma 01](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg)

The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.

**Step 1: Select the green screen clip**

From the **Effects Browser > Keying** category, double-click the **Keyer** effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)

![fx chroma 02](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg)

Don't panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.

![fx chroma 03](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg)

Click the **Sample Color** icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.

![fx chroma 04](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg)

In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.

Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:

* Cleaning up the matte
* Edge adjustments
* Light wrap

![fx chroma 06](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg)

Click the **Matte** button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.

![fx chroma 07](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg)

Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the **Fill Holes** and **Edge Distance** sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you'll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)

![fx chroma 05](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg)

If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the **Edges** icon.

![fx chroma 09](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg)

**Step 2: Tweaks Video**

Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.

![fx chroma 09a](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg)

Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:

* Color Selection
* Matte Tools
* Spill Suppression
* Light Wrap

The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)

Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more "organic," as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.

This is a subtle effect, but very cool.

![fx chroma 10](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg)

Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.

![fx chroma 11](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-11.jpg)

When you are done, you have a great looking key!

## Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask

![fx chroma 12](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-12.jpg)

Sometimes, however, you don't have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)

Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there's one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.

![fx chroma 13](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg)

Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn't all that good – drag the Mask effect (**Effects > Keying > Mask**) on top of the green-screen clip.

**NOTE**: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.

![fx chroma 14](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg)

Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I've found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.

However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That's where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It's written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com/fcpx/ – I recommend his effects highly.

If a single video can have over 50K views in one month and a well-targeted video can generate 66% qualified leads ([Optinmoster](https://optinmonster.com/video-marketing-statistics-what-you-must-know/)), how much money can your online business make in a year? It is a fact that millions of individuals and online business owners are using video hosting sites to make a passive income.

In this article, you'll get the best free video hosting sites that will help realize your goals. The internet is full of video sites that are expensive and complex. The list below comprises of the most suitable video sites for both private and online business marketers.

* [Roundup of The Best Video Hosting Services](#part3)
* [FAQs about video hosting sites](#part4)
* [How Filmora Video Editor Can Determine The Success of Your Videos?](#part5)

## Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?

If you intend to host videos on your website, prepare for a myriad of challenges. Hosting videos on one's website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.

These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.

Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.

* **To avoid file format hurdle**

To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.

Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.

* **Storage Space and File Size Limitations**

How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.

It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that's above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.

* **Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic**

According to [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/), there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it's viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.

How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.

* **Help Upload High-Quality Video**

Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.

To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.

Here are the best sites and their features;

## Best Free Video Hosting Sites/Services/Platforms

A number of sites have been offering video hosting services for free overwhelming. Even though there are restrictions as to the content to upload, you can find all the information you need either as a tutorial, music or graphical representation.

#### 1. Vimeo

![video hosting service](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-interface.jpg)

Vimeo is an all-round site. It can, therefore, be used as a business and private video hosting site. Three accounts are at anyone's disposal; free account paid account with plus, Pro, Business and Premium levels and partner account. It's not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.

File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.

#### 2. YouTube

![free video hosting sites](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-interface.jpg)

With over 500hours of video uploaded to YouTube per minute, 5 billion videos watched every day and at least 1.3 billion registered users, we all can bet it the most popular and preferred video hosting platform. YouTube is owned by Google and is the world's second-ranked social platform with 27.80 Billion monthly visitors.

Not many people like the many ads but to the entrepreneurs, it's one of the best video hosting sites for business. They promote their businesses and products and also earn from YouTube. This channel analyses videos and shows the number of viewers, social sharing and related videos.

Verify your account and upload videos of any format of up to 128GB. To watch videos free of ads, subscribe for the premium account. As a free unlimited video hosting site, file size and bandwidth are unlimited but videos cannot exceed 15 minutes

#### 3. Wistia>

![private video hosting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wistia-interface.jpg)

Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.

However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.

While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.

#### 4. Dailymotion

![video hosting platforms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dailymotion-interface.jpg)

With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren't as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn't limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.

However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.

Among the video hosting sites here, this site is less restrictive and easy to share videos to the social media channels. Categorization of the videos offers easy access to ones desired videos.

#### 5. Twitch

![video hosting sites](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitch-interface.jpg)

Twitch is a video streaming hosting service provider that offers live broadcast shows for gamers. This is the world's top-ranked game video hosting platform with 625.10 million monthly visitors. Twitch TV was launched in 2011 and is owned and managed by Amazon.

Being as unique as it may be, Amazon brings its money-making skills to this site by giving video makers a chance to earn from their creativity. Start by creating a channel, and then create unique and interesting video games. Partner with Twitch to earn big from the subscribers who pay $4.99 per month.

#### 6. Vidyard

![online video hosting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidyard-interface.jpg)

Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.

The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans. They include the Pro at $19/Month and come with 20 embedded videos, Starter at $150/Month, Plus at $850/Month and Enterprise at an unspecified amount.

Vidyard offers unlimited bandwidth to its users across all the plans. Whether you are a private, a marketer, professional or an entrepreneur some features meet all your needs. Why is it loved by millions of users? The answer, the easy-to-use dashboard and plenty of features.

#### 7. Google Drive

![video streaming hosting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-drive-video.jpg)

This is part of the large Google family. It is designed for both personal use and business purposes. If you are a first-timer, your new Google Drive account comes with 15GB storage space. Once you've filled the space, upgrade to a paid plan for a bigger space.

Google Drive is the only online video hosting platform that allows you to first save any video file for as long as you want and embeds to your site at any time and anywhere. This site mostly favours professionals working for a multinational company for they can team to work together from the clouds as though in one office.

To realize the better part of Google Drive subscribes for the Drive Enterprise. It is cheap and has plenty to take your business to great heights.

#### 8. Facebook

![list of video hosting sites](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-video-hosting.jpg)

Facebook is the most used social media platform. As a private video hosting site, you have every opportunity to showcase creativity by creating thrilling games and uploading on Facebook. There are over 23.80 billion monthly visitors so the traffic is already more than enough to get enough views.

Facebook isn't limited to gaming videos. Just upload any video file and watch how it's shared and the number of views grows fast. Before your video is hosted, you have to sign up for an account for free.

#### 9. Metacafe

![video hosting sites for business](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/metacafe-interface.jpg)

Search any video category and you'll definitely find it. However, all videos hosted by Metacafe are short and catchy. Other than the three search categories at the top bar-Trending, Latest and Popular- finding the video of your choice is more simplified by the drop-down menu.

To demonstrate products upload your videos to the “How To” category. How much money can you make from Metacafe? Hosting videos on Metacafe is rewarding. Partner with sitting and earn $5 for every 1,000 page views. To attract significant traffic, grow your niche.

#### 10. 9GAG

![anonymous video hosting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9gag-interface.jpg)

9GAG best suits individuals, who are good at creating funny videos, GIF, memes, gaming videos and photo slides. Unlike most video hosting platforms, 9GAG can be used for official purposes. Some of the video content uploaded is risqué therefore not suitable for the underage.

Looking for maximum fun, consider partnering with this site.

## Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?

If you intend to host videos on your website, prepare for a myriad of challenges. Hosting videos on one's website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.

These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.

Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.

* **To avoid file format hurdle**

To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.

Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.

* **Storage Space and File Size Limitations**

How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.

It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that's above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.

* **Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic**

According to [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/), there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it's viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.

How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.

* **Help Upload High-Quality Video**

Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.

To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.

Here are the best sites and their features;

## Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?

If you intend to host videos on your website, prepare for a myriad of challenges. Hosting videos on one's website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.

These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.

Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.

* **To avoid file format hurdle**

To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.

Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.

* **Storage Space and File Size Limitations**

How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.

It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that's above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.

* **Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic**

According to [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/), there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it's viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.

How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.

* **Help Upload High-Quality Video**

Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.

To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.

Here are the best sites and their features;

## Best Free Video Hosting Sites/Services/Platforms

A number of sites have been offering video hosting services for free overwhelming. Even though there are restrictions as to the content to upload, you can find all the information you need either as a tutorial, music or graphical representation.

#### 1. Vimeo

![video hosting service](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vimeo-interface.jpg)

Vimeo is an all-round site. It can, therefore, be used as a business and private video hosting site. Three accounts are at anyone's disposal; free account paid account with plus, Pro, Business and Premium levels and partner account. It's not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.

File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.

#### 2. YouTube

![free video hosting sites](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-interface.jpg)

With over 500hours of video uploaded to YouTube per minute, 5 billion videos watched every day and at least 1.3 billion registered users, we all can bet it the most popular and preferred video hosting platform. YouTube is owned by Google and is the world's second-ranked social platform with 27.80 Billion monthly visitors.

Not many people like the many ads but to the entrepreneurs, it's one of the best video hosting sites for business. They promote their businesses and products and also earn from YouTube. This channel analyses videos and shows the number of viewers, social sharing and related videos.

Verify your account and upload videos of any format of up to 128GB. To watch videos free of ads, subscribe for the premium account. As a free unlimited video hosting site, file size and bandwidth are unlimited but videos cannot exceed 15 minutes

#### 3. Wistia>

![private video hosting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wistia-interface.jpg)

Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.

However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.

While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.

#### 4. Dailymotion

![video hosting platforms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dailymotion-interface.jpg)

With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren't as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn't limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.

However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.

Being as unique as it may be, Amazon brings its money-making skills to this site by giving video makers a chance to earn from their creativity. Start by creating a channel, and then create unique and interesting video games. Partner with Twitch to earn big from the subscribers who pay $4.99 per month.

#### 6. Vidyard

![online video hosting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidyard-interface.jpg)

Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.

The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans. They include the Pro at $19/Month and come with 20 embedded videos, Starter at $150/Month, Plus at $850/Month and Enterprise at an unspecified amount.

Vidyard offers unlimited bandwidth to its users across all the plans. Whether you are a private, a marketer, professional or an entrepreneur some features meet all your needs. Why is it loved by millions of users? The answer, the easy-to-use dashboard and plenty of features.
