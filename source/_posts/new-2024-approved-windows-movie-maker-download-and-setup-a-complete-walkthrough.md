In this article, we will review the AVS editor briefly

## AVS Pros

* You can choose from more than 300 video effects, transitions, titles, and overlays.
* There are various features that make it easy for you to get the perfect results for your videos, such as the ability to flick through shots in your timeline without pausing.
* Based on your skill level, you can choose between two modes: Basic or Advanced.
* If you want to change the pace of your videos while maintaining their quality, you can use the video speed control.

### How To Use AVS Video Editor?

As soon as you have downloaded and installed the software, follow the instructions. The first time you boot up your computer after installing the software, you will see a popup for quick start instructions. It would be a great place to start someday, even if you skip it for now. For an in-depth guide on how to use the software, we recommend watching the videos.

If you open AVS Video Editor for the first time, you'll notice that it shares many features with other editing software. Files can be dragged and dropped directly into the program or imported from other sources, such as your desktop or cloud storage. The camera can also capture media directly from the clipboard and even the desktop screen can be captured.

The timeline displays several buttons for different functions once the media is loaded. A clip can be trimmed, enhanced with a filter, and text or music can be added.

You can add a variety of effects to your videos using AVS Video Editor, which makes it stand out from other video editing software. There are thousands of preset transitions and visual filters available for use within the program once you've opened a clip. Audio and brightness adjustments can also be made.

Other video editing software does not offer the same features as this one. AVS Video Editor, for example, allows you to add watermarks and overlays to videos without any lag time or loss in quality, which would be impossible with other programs.

The animated logos and text in the video are another great feature. Adding an intro or outro to the end of your video will give it that professional touch before you publish it on YouTube.

## How to record desktop with Filmora Scrn

#### Step 1 – Get the Program on Your PC

Initially, Download it and install it. After completing all installation formalities, launch Filmora Scrn on your computer.

#### Step 2 – Go for the Appropriate Option

Now, the main interface will provide you three options which are "Get Started", "Quick Capture" and "Video Editor".

**Get Started** – If you wish to hit on this tab, you will be brought up to a new interface where you can customize the recording parameters according to your preferences.

For instance, customizing audio settings or adjusting the recording area, frame rate, or also to set recording source as webcam (if you need) along with recording your desktop screen.

**Quick Capture** – If you prefer to record your desktop with the default settings, you should then hit on this tab to immediately launch the capturing console.

**Video Editor** – This tab is specifically for the video lovers who wish to edit and enhance their videos by adding annotation effects, cursor effects or by doing some basic video editing (crop, split, resize, rotate and more).

Hit the one that suits you, in this case, hit on "Get Started".

#### Step 3 – Customizing Record Settings

Right after pushing the "Get Started" tab, the "Setup" interface will load up. You will now have 4 different categories to customize the Record Settings.

**Screen** – Customize capturing area on your desktop (full screen, target window or a specific region), set the preferred frame rate (up to 120 FPS) for your video. Or select, "Game" if you wish to record gameplay.

Once finished with customization, hit on "Capture" to launch the recording console.

#### Step 4 – Ready to Capture

Now, the recording console will pop up on your screen and you are just a click away to record your desktop. Hit on the big "Record" button at the top of the console or hit "F10" on your keyboard. A countdown will begin and right after that your recording starts.

If you wish to pause the video, hit "F9" on your keyboard and similarly, hit the same "F9" to resume the recording again. Or, if you wish to stop the video, just have to hit on "F10" key on your keyboard.

#### Step 5 – Edit Video, Add Effects and Export

Finally, in this last step your video will be loaded in the built-in video editor for the final touch up to enhance your video before it is exported to your local storage. You can add annotation effects, cursor effects to your video. Or, do some video editing like crop, split, resize, rotate and more.

When you’re done, export the final file to your local storage and enjoy.
