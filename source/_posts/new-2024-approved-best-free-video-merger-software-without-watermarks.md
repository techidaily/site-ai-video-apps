## Best Free Video Merger Software Without Watermarks

Sometimes, when delving into the vast space of internet and trying to find the perfect online platforms or software in order to edit some videos, it might get frustrating to find only the ones with watermark. But of course, the resources are endless and in case we have some information, we can easily access the free video editing platforms which give us the opportunity to edit our videos without undesired logos on them. In this case, we will be discussing 6 video mergers without watermark, and the way we can use them – the tools and features they offer, and how we can get the best out of them.

* **Photos by Microsoft**

If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.

### How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/merging-videos-photos-app.png)

These are the steps to combine multiple clips in Windows 10 with Photos App.

**Step 1: Open Photos App**

Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.

**Step 2: Make a New Project**

Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.

**Step 3: Add Clips**

Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.

**Step 4: Make a Storyboard**

After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.

* **Fastreel by Movavi**

[Fastreel](https://www.fastreel.com/) is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop/add multiple files right away.

Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-6.jpg)

Then it will take you to the editor, where you can join the videos. It’s possible to rearrange the files, by using drag-and-drop until they're in the desired order.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-10.jpg)

The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-11.jpg)

Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.

* **Wondershare Filmora**

Last but not least – [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) ! Even it differs from other abovementioned video mergers, as in it is not totally free and adds a Filmora logo on exported project, it’s a great suggestion for people who want to make their videos look great with the help of various tools.
