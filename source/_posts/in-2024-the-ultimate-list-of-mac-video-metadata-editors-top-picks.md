Metadata is the pieces of information that help viewers understand what a video is about without having to watch it from start to finish. Things like titles, keywords, tags, timestamps, and descriptions are some metadata that should be added to a video before it is published online.

Adding the right metadata to your video is useful for many reasons. It makes it easy for search engines to correctly identify and index your video. This in turn helps viewers find your video when they search Google, iTunes, or video sharing platforms like YouTube and Vimeo.

For more experienced videographers, metadata is useful at every stage of the process of making a video, from production to post-production and publishing. Without the right metadata, professional video production and editing would be a very uphill task.

The best multimedia editors have metadata editing features. It’s also good to have a lightweight, standalone application to edit and customize video metadata quickly. In this post, we share the 8 best video metadata editors for macOS users.

## 8 Best Video Metadata Editors for Mac

### 1. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is a powerful, easy-to-use multimedia editor released in early 2019\. It’s a new and improved version of the classic Filmora video editor, with many features on par with elite video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro. It can be purchased for roughly $60 though a trial version is available for free.

**FEATURES:** This software makes video editing easy with lots of extras like built-in audio tracks, sound effects, title presets, transition effects, and more. FilmoraPro lets users add metadata during the export process. Simply click the export button, which is now at the top of the media window. In the pop-up screen, click on the YouTube, Vimeo, or DVD tab, depending on how you want to publish your video, and edit the title, description, tags, category and privacy settings accordingly.

### 2. [iFlicks](https://iflicks.app/)

iFlicks is a media conversion and video metadata editor for macOS. In addition to being able to perform a variety of video format conversions, iFlicks supports detailed metadata editing and interacts seamlessly with iTunes. This app is available for a one-time fee or on a subscription basis.

These days, people are relying on social media to grab the attention of their audience but this is not possible without the correct creation of the videos. That's how we will start on talking about **Social Media Aspect Ratio**.

#### In this article

02 [Why is It Important to Get Social Media Video Sizes Right?](#Part 2)

03 [What Aspect Ratio Should Be Selected for Different Application Scenario?](#Part 3)

04 [5 Tips for Creating Better Vertical Videos for Social Media](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Which Platform Do You Want to Optimize Your Video For? Will It Be YouTube, Facebook or Instagram?

Videos have become the great tool nowadays in order to get your brand’s conversion higher. The reason behind this is people feel more connected and engaged in the videos rather than text content. Moreover, it is more important to know that videos get about 135% more reach on Facebook and Instagram. On Twitter these video contents get 6 times more retweeted. However, specs and **Social Media Aspect Ratio** get a constant change. So, it is important to keep changing the sizes and video aspects as per the demands. No matter the videos are on YouTube, Facebook or Instagram, if they will not stand out on all the guidelines then they will lose the reach.
