It will be more interesting to change the speed of a video to give your project a totally different feeling, for example, by speeding up a video of a city’s traffic or the flow of clouds. Final Cut Pro offers users multiple options to adjust video speed easily, including time-lapse.

In this article, we are going to show you how you can easily increase the speed of your video from 2X up to 20X with Final Cut Pro. Also, you can choose manual custom speed as you like.

## How to Make a Time-Lapse Video in Final Cut Pro

#### Step 1 Import Clips

Choose **File** \> **New** \> **Event**. Name it and click **OK**. Label the project **Timelapse**. Then go to **File** \> **Import Media**. Browse to source clips folder. Click **Import Selected**. Drop the clips onto the timeline.

#### Step 2 Apply Time-lapse Effect

Click the **Retime** pop-up menu below the viewer and choose **Fast** (or you can access **Modify** \> **Retime** \> **Fast**). There are 4 preset options you can choose: 2x, 4x, 8x, 20x. Or you can customize the speed by selecting **Custom**.

You can set any speed by adjusting the **Rate**. Reset the speed by clicking on the little arrow on the right side of the window.

![ Apply Timelapse effect -2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/timelapse-in-fcp-3.png)

You can also drag the retiming handle to adjust the speed: dragging to the left increases the speed, and dragging to the right decreases it.

**Note:** To set speed separately for different parts of one clip, you can choose **Blade Speed** first, and then blade the clip where you want to set different speeds.
