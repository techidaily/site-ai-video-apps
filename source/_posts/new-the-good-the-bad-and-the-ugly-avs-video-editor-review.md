### How To Use AVS Video Editor?

As soon as you have downloaded and installed the software, follow the instructions. The first time you boot up your computer after installing the software, you will see a popup for quick start instructions. It would be a great place to start someday, even if you skip it for now. For an in-depth guide on how to use the software, we recommend watching the videos.

If you open AVS Video Editor for the first time, you'll notice that it shares many features with other editing software. Files can be dragged and dropped directly into the program or imported from other sources, such as your desktop or cloud storage. The camera can also capture media directly from the clipboard and even the desktop screen can be captured.

The timeline displays several buttons for different functions once the media is loaded. A clip can be trimmed, enhanced with a filter, and text or music can be added.

You can add a variety of effects to your videos using AVS Video Editor, which makes it stand out from other video editing software. There are thousands of preset transitions and visual filters available for use within the program once you've opened a clip. Audio and brightness adjustments can also be made.

Other video editing software does not offer the same features as this one. AVS Video Editor, for example, allows you to add watermarks and overlays to videos without any lag time or loss in quality, which would be impossible with other programs.

The animated logos and text in the video are another great feature. Adding an intro or outro to the end of your video will give it that professional touch before you publish it on YouTube.

### 1\. Adobe Photoshop

**Price:** $20.99 per month as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Adobe Photoshop is one of the best photo editing software ever created, which is why it is hardly surprising that it can help you to cartoon a photo. Photoshop’s rich selection of effects includes a number of effects you can use to turn a photo into a cartoon.

However, you will also have to create several layers, change blend modes, and create masks. Effects such as Sketch, Ink Outlines, or Cutout can all be used during this process, and you can also combine several effects while turning a photo into a cartoon. Needless to say, inexperienced photo editors can find this task overwhelming, because it requires a lot of patience and excellent knowledge of the software’s features.

**Compatibility:** Windows

PC owners in need of a simple photo editing software that can help them turn a photo into a cartoon are going to love using Paint.net. This is a simple photo editor that has more to offer than Microsoft Paint, and it is as easy to use.

In order to cartoon a photo with Paint.net, you just have to import it into the editor and then head over to the Effects menu. After you locate the Artistic sub-menu, you should pick the Ink Sketch option and then adjust the Coloring and Ink Outline options. Optionally, you can also add Noise to the photo you’re cartooning if it fits the style you’re trying to achieve.

Each effect can be edited so that it fits your image better, and if you don’t like how the effect matches your photo you can always hit the undo button and try another one. Click on the Apply icon to confirm the changes you’ve made and proceed to save the cartoon you created to your hard drive.

### 4\. XnSketch

Moreover, the software supports a broad range of image files, which enables you to edit your photos regardless of the format in which they are saved.

So, once you open a photo you want to edit in XnSketch you should either click on Cartoon 1 or Cartoon 2 options and then proceed to adjust Hue, Saturation, Brightness, and Contrast. When done you can easily save your creations and share them on social networks, but you cannot upload photos to an account on social media directly from XnSketch.

### 5\. FotoSketcher

However, you will also have to create several layers, change blend modes, and create masks. Effects such as Sketch, Ink Outlines, or Cutout can all be used during this process, and you can also combine several effects while turning a photo into a cartoon. Needless to say, inexperienced photo editors can find this task overwhelming, because it requires a lot of patience and excellent knowledge of the software’s features.
