## **GoPro Quik PC- An Overview**

GoPro Quik is a video editing software that allows you to edit your GoPro videos and photos within no time.

## **GoPro Quik Windows Features**

### 2.Auto Cloud Uploads

Another amazing feature of GoPro Quik is that once you have done editing your videos, they will be automatically uploaded to your cloud. But for this feature to work, make sure that you have an active GoPro PLUS subscription.

### 5.New Speed Tool

Tap the pencil to choose the Speed icon for the video in your Media Mural. Then you can apply more than one-speed effect simultaneously. The speed can be toggled between real-time and half-speed slow motion. You can also add freeze frames for a specified period of time.

### 6.GoPro-Exclusive filters

From Media or Mural, select a photo or video and tap the pencil. In order to optimize the footage to the environment it was shot in, GoPro has created 25 filters in-house. By using the scrub bar, you can adjust the intensity of each filter.

### 7.Premium Themes

Alternatively, you may create a new highlight from Media. You will be presented with 13 video editing themes. Besides adding text and transitions, you can also change the music, choose the duration, and choose the right format for your intended sharing platform, such as social media or text.

##### Pros

Despite its ease and quickness, there are a few drawbacks to it. First, I must say this is awesome and perfect for anyone who has never edited a GoPro video before. When you're new to video editing software, it can be very easy to become frustrated and overwhelmed, so it's great for those who aren't familiar with it. It's all about getting that video off your memory card and putting it out there. That's it.

##### Cons

You cannot edit footage from your phone or DSLR with Quik App for Desktop - only GoPro footage can be used in Quik App. This is a GoPro app, after all. It should be used with GoPro content!

In addition to the ten free songs, GoPro Plus members have access to an additional song library. Users cannot import their own music either.

Additionally, you may only create a certain number of Highlights. Each 30-second video is limited to 10 Highlights.

## Final Verdict

Although GoPro Quik is amazing and comes with a lot of features, there are still many limitations of this application, as discussed in the cons section of this article. If you want to do basic editing, then this app will do just good, but if you are looking for advanced features like audio normalization, keyframing, color tuning, gif support, etc., then you will have to use another fully-fledged video editing app. We recommend you to give a try to our [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor.

Filmora comes with plenty of features and can easily compete with the most advanced video editors in the world. The best thing is, you can download and install it for free and try all of its features without paying a penny. Also, there is an amazing community and Filmora support that you won’t find anywhere else.
