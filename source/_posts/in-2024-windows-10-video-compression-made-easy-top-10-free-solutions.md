Unless you are recording your footage on professional video cameras, chances are that your video clips are already compressed by the time you transfer them to a PC computer and import them into video compression software.

**Codecs** can either be lossless or lossy, depending on the method utilized to load or discard information that doesn’t change during a recording.

Moreover, [changing the file format](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of a video can also lower its size, but if you opt for this method you won’t be able to control how much your videos are going to be compressed.

Besides resolution reduction, you can also **lower a video’s bitrate and frame rate.** As you[reduce the number of frames](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that are displayed every second the size of a video file also shrinks. However, the quality of the video is going to drop as you reduce the number of frames that are displayed each second.

Most consumer-level video recording devices are relying on codecs to compress videos while the recording is still in progress.

**Codecs** can either be lossless or lossy, depending on the method utilized to load or discard information that doesn’t change during a recording. The lossy codec formats reduce the size of a video file considerably but they lower the video’s quality, which is why it is better to use lossless codecs if you are recording videos for YouTube and other social media platforms.

## Part 3: What are the Most Common Video Compression and File Size Reduction Methods Utilized by Video Compression Apps?

After the video recording process is completed there a number of methods you can use to **reduce the size of the file** you created. The fastest and the easiest way to compress a video is to **[change its resolution.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** So, if you shot a video in 4K resolution changing its resolution to Full HD will reduce its size.

Most video compressor apps offer **preset output video resolutions** and allow you to change the resolution value manually. Moreover, [changing the file format](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of a video can also lower its size, but if you opt for this method you won’t be able to control how much your videos are going to be compressed.

Besides resolution reduction, you can also **lower a video’s bitrate and frame rate.** As you[reduce the number of frames](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that are displayed every second the size of a video file also shrinks. However, the quality of the video is going to drop as you reduce the number of frames that are displayed each second.

Probably the best way to keep your video files under a certain size limit is to **[shorten their duration](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).** Trimming or cutting out all the parts of a video clip can help you shrink its size, which makes it easier to upload to YouTube or any other social media platform that supports video content.

## **Conclusion**

Compressing video files on Windows 10 is a simple process regardless of the video compressor app you choose. However, the number of the video compression tool you’ll have at your disposal can impact the quality of the output video. That’s why you have to pick a free video compressor for Windows 10 that caters to all your needs. Which of the five free video compressors for Windows 10 we covered in this article are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.
