## **GoPro Quik Windows Features**

GoPro Quik app is rich with features, and it provides pretty much everything that you need to create amazing photos and videos. A few highlighting features are discussed below:

### 1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks

With GoPro Quik, making amazing videos is very easy. With just a few clicks, you can import all your videos and photos. Then you can edit them in just a few clicks. Everything here is so simple that you will feel like a pro video editor yourself.

### 2.Auto Cloud Uploads

Another amazing feature of GoPro Quik is that once you have done editing your videos, they will be automatically uploaded to your cloud. But for this feature to work, make sure that you have an active GoPro PLUS subscription.

### 3.Excellent editing

Simply click a few buttons to turn GoPro footage into an awesome video. Pick the perfect soundtrack, then pick your favorite moments. Your video automatically syncs with the music, so you can share it in just a few seconds. Make your videos come alive with panning effects by adding photos and time-lapse sequences.

### 4.Share with friends

Make short videos that are ideal for posting on Facebook, YouTube, and more. Make a unique video from your burst and timelapse photos. Additionally, you can find and save the most memorable moments in a video, then share them as high-quality still images.

### 5.New Speed Tool

Tap the pencil to choose the Speed icon for the video in your Media Mural. Then you can apply more than one-speed effect simultaneously. The speed can be toggled between real-time and half-speed slow motion. You can also add freeze frames for a specified period of time.

### 6.GoPro-Exclusive filters

From Media or Mural, select a photo or video and tap the pencil. In order to optimize the footage to the environment it was shot in, GoPro has created 25 filters in-house. By using the scrub bar, you can adjust the intensity of each filter.

### 7.Premium Themes

Alternatively, you may create a new highlight from Media. You will be presented with 13 video editing themes. Besides adding text and transitions, you can also change the music, choose the duration, and choose the right format for your intended sharing platform, such as social media or text.

##### Pros

Despite its ease and quickness, there are a few drawbacks to it. First, I must say this is awesome and perfect for anyone who has never edited a GoPro video before. When you're new to video editing software, it can be very easy to become frustrated and overwhelmed, so it's great for those who aren't familiar with it. It's all about getting that video off your memory card and putting it out there. That's it.

##### Cons

You cannot edit footage from your phone or DSLR with Quik App for Desktop - only GoPro footage can be used in Quik App. This is a GoPro app, after all. It should be used with GoPro content!

In addition to the ten free songs, GoPro Plus members have access to an additional song library. Users cannot import their own music either.

Additionally, you may only create a certain number of Highlights. Each 30-second video is limited to 10 Highlights.

## Final Verdict

Although GoPro Quik is amazing and comes with a lot of features, there are still many limitations of this application, as discussed in the cons section of this article. If you want to do basic editing, then this app will do just good, but if you are looking for advanced features like audio normalization, keyframing, color tuning, gif support, etc., then you will have to use another fully-fledged video editing app. We recommend you to give a try to our [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor.

Filmora comes with plenty of features and can easily compete with the most advanced video editors in the world. The best thing is, you can download and install it for free and try all of its features without paying a penny.

This article explains major concepts about **16x9 ratio calculator** and applies them even if you are a novice.

Read it to conclude the aspect ratio and the type of editing you need for your videos.

#### In this article

01 [What is Aspect Ratio?](#Part 1)

02 [What's 16:9 Ratio Calculator?](#Part 2)

03 [Top 16:9 Resolutions](#Part 3)

04 [How to Calculate 16:9 Aspect Ratios?](#Part 4)

05 [How to Use Aspect Ratio Calculator?](#Part 5)

06 [How to Shift Through Aspect Ratio You Prefer in Filmora?](#Part 6)

## Part 1 **What is aspect ratio?**

Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen's width will be almost twice as high as its height.

However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don't miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.

Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the**16\*9 aspect ratio calculator.**

Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.

Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.

Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.

## Part 2 **What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?**

The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9\. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.

You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.

The**16 \* 9 aspect ratio**calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.

## Part 3 **Top 16:9 resolutions**

These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.

**●** 15360×8640 (16K UHD)

**●** 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)

**●** 5120 × 2880 (5K)

**●** 3840 × 2160 (4K UHD)

**●** 3200 × 1800 (QHD+)

**●** 2560 × 1440 (QHD)

**●** 1920 × 1080 (Full HD)

**●** 1600 × 900 (HD+)

**●** 1366 × 768 (WXGA)

**●** 1280 × 720 (HD)

**●** 960 × 540 (qHD)

**●** 854 × 480 (FWVGA)

**●** 640 × 360 (nHD)

## Part 4 **How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?**

First, let's look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9\. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9\. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.

Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3\. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The**16\*9 ratio calculator**is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920/1080 equals 16:9.

First, here's the formula that we will use in this section.

Width (W) /Height (H) = 1.778

Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.

1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.

Example 1:

Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.

W/H = 16/9

32/H = 16/9

H =32 × 9/16

H = 18

Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.

Example 2

Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9\. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.

W/H = 19/6

W/720 = 19/6

W = 730 × 19/6

06 [How to Shift Through Aspect Ratio You Prefer in Filmora?](#Part 6)

## Part 1 **What is aspect ratio?**

Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen's width will be almost twice as high as its height.

However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don't miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.

Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the**16\*9 aspect ratio calculator.**

Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.

Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.

Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.

## Part 2 **What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?**

The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9\. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.

You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.

The**16 \* 9 aspect ratio**calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.

## Part 3 **Top 16:9 resolutions**

These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.

**●** 15360×8640 (16K UHD)

**●** 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)

**●** 5120 × 2880 (5K)

**●** 3840 × 2160 (4K UHD)

**●** 3200 × 1800 (QHD+)

**●** 2560 × 1440 (QHD)

**●** 1920 × 1080 (Full HD)

**●** 1600 × 900 (HD+)

**●** 1366 × 768 (WXGA)

**●** 1280 × 720 (HD)

**●** 960 × 540 (qHD)

**●** 854 × 480 (FWVGA)

**●** 640 × 360 (nHD)

## Part 4 **How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?**

First, let's look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9\. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9\. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.

Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3\. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The**16\*9 ratio calculator**is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920/1080 equals 16:9.

First, here's the formula that we will use in this section.

Width (W) /Height (H) = 1.778

Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.

1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.

Example 1:

Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.

W/H = 16/9

32/H = 16/9

H =32 × 9/16

H = 18

Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.

Example 2

Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9\. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.

W/H = 19/6

W/720 = 19/6

W = 730 × 19/6

Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.

## Part 5 **How to use an aspect ratio calculator?**

These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time.

The**16 \* 9 aspect ratio**calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.

## Part 3 **Top 16:9 resolutions**

These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.

**●** 15360×8640 (16K UHD)

**●** 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)

**●** 5120 × 2880 (5K)

**●** 3840 × 2160 (4K UHD)

**●** 3200 × 1800 (QHD+)

**●** 2560 × 1440 (QHD)

**●** 1920 × 1080 (Full HD)

**●** 1600 × 900 (HD+)

**●** 1366 × 768 (WXGA)

**●** 1280 × 720 (HD)

**●** 960 × 540 (qHD)

**●** 854 × 480 (FWVGA)

**●** 640 × 360 (nHD)

## Part 4 **How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?**

First, let's look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9\. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9\. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.

Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3\. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The**16\*9 ratio calculator**is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920/1080 equals 16:9.

First, here's the formula that we will use in this section.

Width (W) /Height (H) = 1.778

Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.

1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.

Example 1:

Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.

W/H = 16/9

32/H = 16/9

H =32 × 9/16

H = 18

Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.

Example 2

Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9\. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.

W/H = 19/6

W/720 = 19/6

W = 730 × 19/6

Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.

## Part 5 **How to use an aspect ratio calculator?**

These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 \*9 ratio calculator will give the **remaining distance.**

Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.

The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:

**Step 1:** Go to <https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/>

**Step 2:** Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.
