## Part 1 Key Facebook Cover Video Specifications

A Facebook cover video works like a mini-advertisement that is played on a loop continuously. To keep the visitors engaged and interested in the video, the video needs to look neat, clean, bright and in the right size and the aspect ratio to fit perfectly in the given space. Key specifications for the cover video are enlisted below.

**Video cover Facebook size**: As such, there are no specific size guidelines issues but it is recommended to keep the size of the video less than 1.75GB. The small size will ensure that users having slower browsing speed can also watch the video in a hassle-free manner.

Dimensions of the video: A video to be used as a cover should be at least 820 X 312 pixels and to get the optimum results it is suggested to keep it around 820 X 462 pixels. If you will watch the video on a desktop, it will be cropped from the sides, or the top or bottom. Thus, to ensure that the video looks perfect on a phone as well as desktop keep the aspect ratio at 16:9 and place the important text or other content at the center.

File type of the video: Videos in MP4 or MOV format are suggested to be used as the cover video and their resolution should be a maximum of 1080p.

Duration of the video: A Facebook cover video can be between 20 seconds to 90 seconds and you can also choose to play it on a loop.

Click "Add videos and photos" to browse and select videos and photos from your computer to add. You can also drag and drop videos and photos to the storyboard.

### Step 2\. Split videos in Windows Live Movie Maker

There are two ways to use Windows Live Movie Maker split function: 1\. Choose the video point where you want to split, right-click the video clip, and click "split". 2\. Select the video point you will split. Under "Video Tools", click the "Edit" tab, and then click the "split" button.

After that, your video will be split into separate sections. And you can edit separate videos as you like and drag and drop to move the location.

### Step 3\. Save and share your videos

Click the icon at the top left, then choose Save movie. There are four output video qualities to choose from. When you place your mouse cursor on each option, you can see the output video display size, aspect ratio, etc. You can also burn the videos to DVD by clicking Burn a DVD item and select a destination folder to save your video file.
