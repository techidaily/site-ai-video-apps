**Cons**

* It sometimes lags, which is inconvenient

## 2\. Shotcut

However, because Shotcut was created for Linux, many users may find the UI a little strange. Regardless, it's still a fantastic editor.

**Cons**

Some of the aesthetic options include color effects and borders, while others enhance the clip by sharpening the image or reducing noise. You may even add other clips to the end of your existing one, although this type of work would be better suited to a complete non-linear editor.

There are many video editing apps that you can use on both a mobile device or a desktop computer. If you’re editing vlog videos on iPhone, you can use the free built-in iMovie.

Yes, of course, you can vlog with your iPhone or Android phone. In recent days, most phones are equipped with a high-quality camera, and with the help of some camera shoot apps and video editing apps, you can totally record, edit and upload vlog videos on your phone.

## Part 3: How to Make Stop Motion Videos from Videos Online

In case you don’t have the photos you can use to create a stop motion animation, platforms like Kapwing allow you to turn a regular video into a stop motion video. All you need to do is upload a video clip from your computer or via a URL to Kapwing and the platform will automatically generate a stop motion video. One of the best part is that Kapwing also provides a sample if you don’t want to upload your own footage.

![ kapwing stop motion maker interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker.jpg)

While adjusting these settings you should keep in mind that lowering a [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) too much can result in choppy footage and uneven movement of the objects in the stop motion video you’re creating.

Kapwing also offers the option to [play the video in reverse](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but finding the right context to use this feature can prove to be a challenging task. Click on the Create button when ready to export the stop motion video and wait for the platform to generate the video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker export & share](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker-export.jpg)

Afterward, you can choose to download, edit or share the video on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter.

After you upload a video clip from your computer or a URL you can set the speed at which frames are going to be displayed and pick the rate at which frames are going to be taken from the video. When done you should simply click on the Create button and wait for the platform to generate a stop motion video.

This tool only offers basic options, which means that you can snap photos, adjust their [playback speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), erase them or record audio.

## Part 2: How to Make Stop Motion Video from Photos Online

The Cloud Stop Motion app offers a free and easy way to make stop motion animations directly from the web-browser using the [web camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

After you sign in to your account on this platform, you should click on the New Project option that is located in the Projects tab.

![ Create Stop Motion with Captured Photos  - create project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-project-in-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Once the Animation window loads, you will be able to see the timeline below the preview window that shows everything your web camera can see. After you composed your shot, you should simply click on the Camera button that is located on the right side of the screen, then move the object that is in the shot and click on the camera button again. You should repeat this process as many times as necessary until you have captured all the frames you want to include in your stop motion animation.

![ Capture Photos in  Cloud Stop Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-photos-with-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

In case you want to alter the frame rate, you can click on the Project Settings icon that is located at the top of the toolbar in the upper left corner of the screen.

![ Cloud Stop Motion Project Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-project-settings.jpg)

Clicking on the Audio icon will grant you access to the Cloud Stop Motion’s [sound library](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that contains hundreds of songs and audio effects. What’s more, you can also record voiceovers with this online stop motion maker, although you must first give the app permission to access your computer’s microphone.

![    Cloud Stop Motion Audio Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-audio-library.jpg)

Cloud Stop Motion is equipped with fully customizable title, credit, speech bubble, and chapter heading templates and you just have to click on them to add them to a project.

![    Cloud Stop Motion Titles Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-insert-titles.jpg)

Click on the Export button, after you complete all work on a project and proceed to choose the video’s aspect ratio or its export size. Keep in mind that changing a stop motion video’s output format is not possible since you can only [create MP4 videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with Cloud Stop Motion.

![    Cloud Stop Motion Export Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-export-options.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Make Stop Motion Videos from Videos Online

In case you don’t have the photos you can use to create a stop motion animation, platforms like Kapwing allow you to turn a regular video into a stop motion video. All you need to do is upload a video clip from your computer or via a URL to Kapwing and the platform will automatically generate a stop motion video. One of the best part is that Kapwing also provides a sample if you don’t want to upload your own footage.

![    Import footage to Kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-stop-motion-footage-in-kapwing.jpg)

After the upload process is completed a new window will load where you can choose the speed at which frames are displayed on the screen and pick the rate at which frames are taken from the source video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker.jpg)

While adjusting these settings you should keep in mind that lowering a [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) too much can result in choppy footage and uneven movement of the objects in the stop motion video you’re creating.

Kapwing also offers the option to [play the video in reverse](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but finding the right context to use this feature can prove to be a challenging task. Click on the Create button when ready to export the stop motion video and wait for the platform to generate the video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker export & share](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker-export.jpg)

Afterward, you can choose to download, edit or share the video on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. In case you created a stop motion video while you were logged out of your Kapwing account, the platform will add a watermark to it, and you must sign in to [remove](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it.
