<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

                      alt="pro-apps"
                ></p>
<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

                      alt="pro-apps"
                ></p>
<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>
<p>For beginners who don’t actually need those many apps can always go with a <strong>cheaper yet maybe better editor, Filmora</strong>. Click and have a try!</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>

However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >why 4K is better than 1080P <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is <strong>Yes</strong>, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.</p>

                      alt="4kvs1080"
                ></p>
<p>Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.</p>
<p>So do not wait…</p>
<p>Let us dive into the detail:</p>
<h3 id="What-is-a-4k"><a href="#What-is-a-4k" class="headerlink" title="What is a 4k?"></a>What is a 4k?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has <strong>3840 x 2160px</strong> or <strong>4096 x 2160</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.</p>

                      alt="4k"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.</li>
<li>It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.</li>
<li>It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.</li>
<li>If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.<br><strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>It occupies more space on your camera.</li>
<li>It is harder to record.</li>
<li>It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.</li>
<li>There is limited content for 4k videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-a1080p"><a href="#What-is-a1080p" class="headerlink" title="What is a1080p?"></a>What is a1080p?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has <strong>1920 x 1080px</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.<br><img

                      alt="1080"
                ><br><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.</li>
<li>It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.</li>
<li>It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).</li>
<li>It has a much better focus than 4k.</li>
<li>Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.</li>
<li>1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. <strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.</li>
<li>It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.</li>
<li>You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.<br><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="scale"
                ><br>In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.</li>

<p>We have been familiar with 1080p resolution for quite some years. However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >why 4K is better than 1080P <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>The 4k technology allows the users to enjoy a very detailed screen of movies and videos which was not possible before. Though there are some 4K devices just as what we have rated before such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K monitor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> nowadays, 4k being relatively new, not all people have access to 4K devices and sometimes, and there are rather limited options to play 4K videos in a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4k video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. 4k being relatively new, there are not many devices that support 4k and rather limited options to play these videos in a 4k video player.</p>

<h3 id="4k-vs-1080p-1"><a href="#4k-vs-1080p-1" class="headerlink" title="4k vs 1080p"></a>4k vs 1080p</h3><p>It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?</p>
<p><strong>Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is <strong>Yes</strong>, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.</p>

                      alt="4kvs1080"
                ></p>
<p>Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.</p>
<p>So do not wait…</p>
<p>Let us dive into the detail:</p>
<h3 id="What-is-a-4k-1"><a href="#What-is-a-4k-1" class="headerlink" title="What is a 4k?"></a>What is a 4k?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has <strong>3840 x 2160px</strong> or <strong>4096 x 2160</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="4k"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.</li>
<li>It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.</li>
<li>It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.</li>
<li>If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.<br><strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>It occupies more space on your camera.</li>
<li>It is harder to record.</li>
<li>It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.</li>
<li>There is limited content for 4k videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-a1080p-1"><a href="#What-is-a1080p-1" class="headerlink" title="What is a1080p?"></a>What is a1080p?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has <strong>1920 x 1080px</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.<br><img

                ><br><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.</li>
<li>It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.</li>
<li>It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).</li>
<li>It has a much better focus than 4k.</li>
<li>Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.</li>
<li>1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. <strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.</li>
<li>It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.</li>
<li>You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.<br><img

                ><br>In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.</li>

And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >why 4K is better than 1080P <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

<p>While we’ve updated the list of best 4K video converters and add some more Video Converters that support 4K resolution. Both of them support Windows and Mac versions, and some of them are totally free to use while others may need to pay to convert 4K video footage.</p>
<h3 id="4k-vs-1080p-2"><a href="#4k-vs-1080p-2" class="headerlink" title="4k vs 1080p"></a>4k vs 1080p</h3><p>It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?</p>
<p><strong>Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is <strong>Yes</strong>, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.</p>

                      alt="4kvs1080"
                ></p>
<p>Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.</p>
<p>So do not wait…</p>
<p>Let us dive into the detail:</p>
<h3 id="What-is-a-4k-2"><a href="#What-is-a-4k-2" class="headerlink" title="What is a 4k?"></a>What is a 4k?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has <strong>3840 x 2160px</strong> or <strong>4096 x 2160</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.</p>

                      alt="4k"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.</li>
<li>It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.</li>
<li>It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.</li>
<li>If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.<br><strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>It occupies more space on your camera.</li>
<li>It is harder to record.</li>
<li>It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.</li>
<li>There is limited content for 4k videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-a1080p-2"><a href="#What-is-a1080p-2" class="headerlink" title="What is a1080p?"></a>What is a1080p?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has <strong>1920 x 1080px</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.<br><img

                      alt="1080"
                ><br><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.</li>
<li>It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.</li>
<li>It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).</li>
<li>It has a much better focus than 4k.</li>
<li>Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.</li>
<li>1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. <strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.</li>
<li>It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.</li>
<li>You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.<br><img

                      alt="scale"
                ><br>In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.</li>

<p>We have been familiar with 1080p resolution for quite some years. However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >why 4K is better than 1080P <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

<h3 id="4k-vs-1080p-3"><a href="#4k-vs-1080p-3" class="headerlink" title="4k vs 1080p"></a>4k vs 1080p</h3><p>It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?</p>
<p><strong>Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is <strong>Yes</strong>, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.</p>

                      alt="4kvs1080"
                ></p>
<p>Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.</p>
<p>So do not wait…</p>
<p>Let us dive into the detail:</p>
<h3 id="What-is-a-4k-3"><a href="#What-is-a-4k-3" class="headerlink" title="What is a 4k?"></a>What is a 4k?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has <strong>3840 x 2160px</strong> or <strong>4096 x 2160</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="4k"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.</li>
<li>It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.</li>
<li>It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.</li>
<li>If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.<br><strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>It occupies more space on your camera.</li>
<li>It is harder to record.</li>
<li>It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.</li>
<li>There is limited content for 4k videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-is-a1080p-3"><a href="#What-is-a1080p-3" class="headerlink" title="What is a1080p?"></a>What is a1080p?</h3><p>As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has <strong>1920 x 1080px</strong> horizontally and vertically and <strong>16:9</strong> is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.<br><img

                      alt="1080"
                ><br><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.</li>
<li>It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.</li>
<li>It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).</li>
<li>It has a much better focus than 4k.</li>
<li>Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.</li>
<li>1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. <strong>Cons</strong></li>
<li>Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.</li>
<li>It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.</li>
<li>You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.<br><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="scale"
                ><br>In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.</li>
